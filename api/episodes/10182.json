Charlie thinks this is a very good idea as there's so much stuff strewn about that it's hard to move around. Lola, however, feels that things in the room are not \"untidy,\" they're merely \"spread out.\" Charlie tries to show Lola how much easier it would be to find things if they were put away properly. Lola doesn't want to move anything, but she begins to reconsider when Charlie moves out.\n","Runtime":12,"FirstAired":"2006-09-04T00:00:00Z","ParentalRating":"G","ParentalRatingReason":"G","Director":"Kitty Taylor","Writer":"Samantha Hill (II), Bridget Hurst","GuestStars":"Ryan Harris","Rating":7,"RatingCount":1,"Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/episodes/75933/308797.jpg","TVDB":308797}
