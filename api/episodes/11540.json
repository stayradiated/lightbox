Damaris has gone, Megan is angry, Den is playing games and Mrs Dethick is back on the ward. On a positive note, Hansley has turned out to be something of a star turn and the Vag-At is going from strength to strength - at least it was, until a mix up with the oncology Christmas card competition leads to complications.
