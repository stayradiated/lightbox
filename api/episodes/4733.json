As we learn about the play, we find that it still doesn't have an ending. We explore more about how the characters are feeling in the play to get a better understanding of it. We also skiddoo into a collage and talk to the characters themselves to try and get a bead on why things happen the way they do in the play.","Runtime":25,"FirstAired":"2000-10-16T00:00:00Z","ParentalRating":"G","Director":"Koyalee Chanda","Writer":"Adam Peltzman","GuestStars":"Jennifer Michelle Brown, Valerie Cosgriff, Sierra Leitner, Thomas Peale, Nijer Peale, Nicky Regina, Billy Tharp","Rating":7,"RatingCount":2,"Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/episodes/76536/199138.jpg","TVDB":199138}
