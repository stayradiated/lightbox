For Raymond it's a great quick technique that gives food a wonderful flavour, colour and texture. He starts with a simple French favourite, pan-fried pork chop on saut√© potatoes, a dish he dedicates to his mum because she has cooked it so often. He conjures up a surprising stir-fried salad as a delicious alternative to the usual summer staple. His dessert is an incredible pan-fried Grand Marnier souffle with an orange sauce.","Runtime":30,"FirstAired":"2013-08-05T00:00:00Z","Year":2013,"ParentalRating":"G","ParentalRatingReason":"G","Rating":1,"RatingCount":1,"Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/episodes/271362/4615356.jpg","TVDB":4615356}
