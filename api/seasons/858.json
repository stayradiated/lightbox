Peter doesn't even know how to right-click a mouse and would rather be celebrating his wedding anniversary, but Stewart Pearson won't hear otherwise. So Fergus is left in charge of drawing up a list of staff redundancies, and Terri Coverley is pretty sure she can make Fergus's hit list if she works hard at under-performing, and finds help from an u","Runtime":30,"FirstAired":"2012-09-08T00:00:00Z","ParentalRating":"R16","ParentalRatingReason":"Lightbox Provisional Classification.

When Helen is accidentally photographed holding notes from an ideas meeting, Nicola is understandably angry. Of course, Nicola is already stressed by having an eight foot pork chop following her about, whilst simultaneously being attacked by the rest of her party for endorsing an unpopular policy. Even worse, her rival Dan Miller seems to be getting on very well with Malcolm Tucker.","Runtime":29,"FirstAired":"2012-09-15T00:00:00Z","ParentalRating":"R16","ParentalRatingReason":"Lightbox Provisional Classification.

No phones, no iPads. Peter Mannion can definitely think of better ways of spending the Easter weekend than 'imagineering' with Stewart, Emma and a bunch of back-benchers and party workers.
