With some help from his friend and mentor, veteran attorney Denny Crane, Shore quickly makes his mark winning cases no one would take, often using less than honest methods. In doing so, he develops a rival in his colleague Brad Chase, who has been assigned to the office partly to keep an eye on the increasingly eccentric (and possibly senile) Denny Crane. Though his questionable conduct might make him a few enemies along the way, Alan's not one to be underestimated, nor will he let trivial things like honesty or integrity get in the way of winning a case.","Poster":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/74058-1.jpg","Fanart":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/fanart/original/74058-6.jpg","Rating":8.5,"RatingCount":29753,"Categories":[1,20,21,37],"DateCreated":"2014-06-27T04:31:55Z","ParentalRating":"M","IMDB":"tt0402711","TVDB":74058,"Seasons":[{"ID":314,"ShowID":113,"DateCreated":"2014-06-27T04:31:55Z","Number":1,"ParentalRating":"M","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/25525-1.jpg","TVDB":6904,"EpisodeCount":17},{"ID":459,"ShowID":113,"DateCreated":"2014-07-14T12:26:12Z","Number":2,"ParentalRating":"M","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/25525-2.jpg","TVDB":6905,"EpisodeCount":27},{"ID":389,"ShowID":113,"DateCreated":"2014-07-03T06:31:45Z","Number":3,"ParentalRating":"M","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/25525-3.jpg","TVDB":16275,"EpisodeCount":24},{"ID":410,"ShowID":113,"DateCreated":"2014-07-04T07:55:50Z","Number":4,"ParentalRating":"M","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/74058-4.jpg","TVDB":28624,"EpisodeCount":20},{"ID":387,"ShowID":113,"DateCreated":"2014-07-03T04:12:44Z","Number":5,"ParentalRating":"M","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/74058-5.jpg","TVDB":32521,"EpisodeCount":13}]}
