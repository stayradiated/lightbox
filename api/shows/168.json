He isn't. That doesn't stop him from embarrassing himself in front of the cameras on a regular basis, whether from his political sermonizing, his stand-up 'comedy', or his incredibly unique dancing. Meanwhile, long-suffering Tim longs after Dawn the engaged receptionist and keeps himself sane by playing childish practical jokes on his insufferable, army-obsessed deskmate Gareth. Will the Slough office be closed? Will the BBC give David a game show? Will Tim and Dawn end up with each other? And more importantly, will Gareth realize what a hopeless prat he is?","Poster":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/78107-4.jpg","Fanart":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/fanart/original/78107-3.jpg","Rating":8.699999809265137,"RatingCount":55228,"Categories":[1,20,37],"DateCreated":"2014-07-14T12:16:34Z","ParentalRating":"M","IMDB":"tt0290978","TVDB":78107,"Seasons":[{"ID":452,"ShowID":168,"DateCreated":"2014-07-14T12:16:34Z","Number":1,"ParentalRating":"M","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/7842-1.jpg","TVDB":14296,"EpisodeCount":6},{"ID":467,"ShowID":168,"DateCreated":"2014-07-16T19:38:15Z","Number":2,"ParentalRating":"M","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/7842-2.jpg","TVDB":14297,"EpisodeCount":8}]}
