{"ID":187,"Title":"Evolve","Released":"2008-07-29T00:00:00Z","Runtime":45,"Plot":"Throughout the eons of its existence, the natural world has played host to this never-ending competition called life. Since the dawn of time, roughly 99 percent of all species have become extinct. In order to survive, all creatures, including man, must treat life as a battlefield and master the natural weapons and defenses that they have evolved: Tyrannosaurus Rex's 13-inch canines; the Gecko's velcro-like toe pads; the Bald Eagle's telescopic vision capable of spotting a hare a mile away. How did these attributes, each unique to the organism itself, appear? Certainly not arbitrarily. They evolved for a common reason - to give these animals a critical edge in inter-species warfare, and to ensure the survival of the individual?s genes into the next generation. To evolve is to survive!","Poster":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/83141-1.jpg","Fanart":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/fanart/original/83141-1.jpg","Rating":8.399999618530273,"RatingCount":72,"Categories":[0,22,34,37],"DateCreated":"2014-07-23T09:41:37Z","ParentalRating":"PG","IMDB":"tt1283572","TVDB":83141,"Seasons":[{"ID":517,"ShowID":187,"DateCreated":"2014-07-23T09:41:37Z","Number":1,"ParentalRating":"PG","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/83141-1.jpg","TVDB":35411,"EpisodeCount":11}]}
