A visit from his only living relative reveals the truth. Nick has inherited the ability to see supernatural creatures, and as a \"Grimm,\" he is tasked with keeping the balance between mankind and the mythological. A reformed \"Big Bad Wolf\" becomes his greatest (and also reluctant) ally and confidant. It's not long before his work as a policeman leads Nick to the criminals he once thought were only found in fairy tales.","Poster":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/248736-1.jpg","Fanart":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/fanart/original/248736-13.jpg","Rating":7.800000190734863,"RatingCount":68067,"Categories":[1,3,16,21,23,30,37,38],"DateCreated":"2014-07-26T08:43:43Z","ParentalRating":"R","IMDB":"tt1830617","TVDB":248736,"Seasons":[{"ID":524,"ShowID":189,"DateCreated":"2014-07-26T08:43:43Z","Number":1,"ParentalRating":"R","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/248736-1.jpg","TVDB":465940,"EpisodeCount":22}]}
