These sins have had different interpretations in Christianity, Islam and Judaism, and some argue that they have even greater significance than the Ten Commandments. The series traces the history of the sins, how they became part of religious doctrine, and looks at historical figures who have been the worst perpetrators of each. Each of the seven sins is explored, from their origins and nature, their opposing virtue, and their corresponding punishment.","Poster":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/114731-1.jpg","Fanart":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/fanart/original/114731-1.jpg","Rating":7.800000190734863,"RatingCount":17,"Categories":[0,10,22,34,37],"DateCreated":"2014-07-30T03:48:04Z","ParentalRating":"M","IMDB":"tt1392068","TVDB":114731,"Seasons":[{"ID":546,"ShowID":193,"DateCreated":"2014-07-30T03:48:04Z","Number":1,"ParentalRating":"M","Image":"http://tdvott-a.akamaihd.net/ondemand/production/image/thumbnails/2014-07/6207-53d8536d32f1c/p285924_b_h9_aa_original_size_1406686179.jpg","TVDB":120551,"EpisodeCount":6}]}
