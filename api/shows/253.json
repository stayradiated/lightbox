The settlers have brought us much of what we hold dear from Earl Grey to olive oil, sheep dogs to fish and chips, scones to war heroes.\n\nIn Here To Stay six well known Kiwis explore the idealism, sense of humour and 'can do' attitude their own pioneering people have brought to these shores. Was there a laugh, a song or a national obsession to be had from the Germans, Chinese, English, Scots, Dalmatians or the Irish?\n\nTravelling the country in search of their own ethnic roots, comedian Ewen Gilmour, entertainer Jackie Clark, rugby legend Frano Botica, reporter/director Bernadine Lim, and actors Michael Hurst and Theresa Healey, take a revealing and entertaining look at what it means to be a Kiwi.","Poster":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/255353-1.jpg","Categories":[0,22,34,37,39],"DateCreated":"2014-10-20T22:37:08Z","ParentalRating":"PG","IMDB":"tt0995379","TVDB":255353,"Seasons":[{"ID":691,"ShowID":253,"DateCreated":"2014-10-20T22:37:08Z","Number":1,"ParentalRating":"PG","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/255353-1.jpg","TVDB":483167,"EpisodeCount":6}]}
