This is hampered by the arrival of a new reporter on the show, the beautiful, funny and multi-talented Serita Singh, whose journalistic style is strikingly similar to Jaquie?s and seems to be stealing her thunder at an alarming rate.\n\nThe series takes a satirical look at the life of a c-grade celebrity and brings the society supplements of the newspapers to frightening fruition as Jaquie encounters, romances and bitch-slaps many of New Zealand?s most well known celebrities.","Poster":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/83511-1.jpg","Fanart":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/fanart/original/83511-1.jpg","Rating":8.199999809265137,"RatingCount":101,"Categories":[0,20,37],"DateCreated":"2014-10-21T21:18:33Z","ParentalRating":"R","IMDB":"tt1269660","TVDB":83511,"Seasons":[{"ID":699,"ShowID":259,"DateCreated":"2014-10-21T21:18:33Z","Number":1,"ParentalRating":"R","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/83511-1-2.jpg","TVDB":36498,"EpisodeCount":6},{"ID":700,"ShowID":259,"DateCreated":"2014-10-21T21:20:25Z","Number":2,"ParentalRating":"R","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/83511-2.jpg","TVDB":141951,"EpisodeCount":8}]}
