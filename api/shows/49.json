She lives with her twenty-something brother/guardian Spencer and produces her Web casts from a makeshift third-floor loft studio. Grappling with adolescence, she never aimed to gain fame as a rising star/underground celebrity to kids. As events unfold in the pilot, it all happens by accident when a teacher puts her in charge of the school talent show. She and her sassy best bud Sam turn the audition process into a show, which Carly's tech savvy smitten friend Freddie tapes - including their hilarious banter and great chemistry - and posts on the Web without telling the girls. The on-line audience clamors for more, and a pop phenomenon blooms, with Carly and sidekick Sam's regular Web casts ultimately featuring everything from comedy sketches and talent contests to interviews, recipes, and problem-solving.","Poster":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/82493-2.jpg","Fanart":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/fanart/original/82493-7.jpg","Rating":6.5,"RatingCount":20631,"Categories":[4,20,36],"DateCreated":"2014-06-19T11:44:51Z","ParentalRating":"PG","IMDB":"tt0972534","TVDB":82493,"Seasons":[{"ID":121,"ShowID":49,"DateCreated":"2014-06-19T11:44:51Z","Number":1,"ParentalRating":"PG","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/82493-1.jpg","TVDB":33661,"EpisodeCount":25},{"ID":132,"ShowID":49,"DateCreated":"2014-06-19T11:46:14Z","Number":2,"ParentalRating":"PG","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/82493-2.jpg","TVDB":37647,"EpisodeCount":45}]}
