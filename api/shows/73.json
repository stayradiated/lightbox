But they have just five minutes more to tell each other a story...\nFive Minutes More is the perfect antidote to the fast-moving images and loud sounds that compete for a child's attention. We all need quiet moments in the day and this new puppet animation series will draw young viewers into the gentle, wonderful world that the bedspread toys inhabit. This is a land where all sorts of fun and amazing adventures can, and do happen.\n\nGeorgie, Louisa, Faraway, Florrie and Sam are best friends. Together, this small group of beanie-style toys live on the patchwork bedspread that covers the child's bed. It's a quilt of beautiful fabric pictures - a castle, a boat out at sea, a forest, a snow scene, a strange fantasy planet and more...\n\nThe toys take it in turns to be the storyteller, while their friends act out the story. We fade into a patchwork picture and find the toys in the land of the imagination","Poster":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/184631-1.jpg","Fanart":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/fanart/original/184631-1.jpg","Rating":7.800000190734863,"RatingCount":11,"Categories":[4,19,35,36],"DateCreated":"2014-06-19T11:50:36Z","ParentalRating":"G","IMDB":"tt0950143","TVDB":184631,"Seasons":[{"ID":188,"ShowID":73,"DateCreated":"2014-06-19T11:50:36Z","Number":1,"ParentalRating":"G","Image":"http://tdvott-a.akamaihd.net/ondemand/production/image/thumbnails/2014-06/1849-53a03526a1798/p8213745_b_h6_aa_original_size_1403008340.jpg","TVDB":301571,"EpisodeCount":4}]}
