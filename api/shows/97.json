The show centers around fifteen-year-old Jenna Hamilton, who, like many, feels invisible to her peers and desperately wants to find her place--which is hard to do in a day and age where fitting in means standing out. Unfortunately, Jenna's visibility comes on the heels of an accident that gives her a not-so-fun stigma. And while the stigma of her accident could be the curse of her life, Jenna's determined to make it her life's blessing.","Poster":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/249882-8.jpg","Fanart":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/fanart/original/249882-7.jpg","Rating":7.800000190734863,"RatingCount":31962,"Categories":[0,1,11,20,37],"DateCreated":"2014-06-19T13:31:52Z","ParentalRating":"M","IMDB":"tt1663676","TVDB":249882,"Seasons":[{"ID":255,"ShowID":97,"DateCreated":"2014-06-19T13:31:52Z","Number":1,"ParentalRating":"M","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/249882-1.jpg","TVDB":469370,"EpisodeCount":12},{"ID":259,"ShowID":97,"DateCreated":"2014-06-19T13:43:14Z","Number":2,"ParentalRating":"M","Image":"http://thetvdb.com/banners/seasons/249882-2.jpg","TVDB":476351,"EpisodeCount":12}]}
