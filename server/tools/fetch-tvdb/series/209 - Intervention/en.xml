  <Overview>Intervention profiles people who are losing the battle with their addictions, and whose friends and families feel the only remaining option is to hold an intervention. Each documentary follows the lives of these addicts, taking an unflinching look at the impact of their addictions on their everyday lives, all the while the addicts are unaware that an intervention is being planned. Each airing ends with the friends, family and a professional interventionist urging the addict to get treatment. If the individual should choose treatment, the addict immediately enters a widely respected treatment facility.</Overview>

  <Overview>They're cheap, easy to get and legal. They're also deadly. But that's not stopping teenagers and young adults from using chemical inhalants to get high. Hundreds of everyday products--household cleaners, disinfectants, computer dusters--contain chemicals that when breathed in give a powerful five-second high. It's called huffing and studies show that over two million kids nationwide are doing it. We'll take a powerful look at the trend and how it is shocking parents and destroying young lives.</Overview>

  <Overview>Once the valedictorian of New Hope Christian Academy, Tina is now a real-life desperate housewife. Taking 10-20 vicodin a day simply to function (and supplementing her usage with percocet), this mother of a 3-and-a-half year old son spends her days gambling her house and car payments while stoned on prescription pills. With most of her jewelry in pawn shops, and forced to take paycheck advances even though her husband of 14 years has a $100,000+ annual income, Tina now writes insurance policies from home and spends her days at horse tracks and in Bingo halls. Favoring horse tracks because she can take her son with her, Tina says that &quot;my addictions have cost me my life.&quot; With her marriage, health and finances in complete crisis (she has spent &quot;hundreds of thousands of dollars on gambling and pills&quot;), her husband Harley says that &quot;this show may be the only thing left that can save our lives.&quot;</Overview>

  <Overview>This story, presented from the Intervention angle, will be an emotional look into the true crisis moment of an upper-middle class  family from picturesque Huntington Beach trying to &quot;save their son from certain death.&quot; Once lovable and talented, Kelly scored well above the genius level with a 160 in Abstract Reasoning on his IQ test. However, Kelly suffers from severe dyslexia and scored a 40 in language. Placed into emotionally and mentally challenged classes as a child, Kelly's family went on to sue the Malibu School System and prevailed - but not before Kelly had lost all of his self-esteem and hopes of a normal education. The grandchild of legendary comedian Jackie Coogan (Uncle Fester on &quot;The Addam's Family&quot;), the now 23-year-old Kelly is a bright, creative and engaging young man - who sleeps in the bushes and uses the jail as a revolving door. Once an athlete excelling in rollerblading, Kelly was recently robbed of his blades while passed out in a park. The story will open as we join Kelly's family searching for him as he has disappeared again on a binge -- the search will start at the local hospitals and jails. The family, in their own words below, sees Intervention as the last hope for their son. Holding Kelly's beloved dog as leverage in the local pound, Leslie and Rob are committed to getting Kelly into treatment at any cost.


This 49-year-old good-looking graduate from Texas Christian University sold commercial real estate and had a promising future. Now, he is addicted to prescription pain medication including heavy amounts of the narcotic, oxycontin. Part of a growing epidemic of back pain sufferers in America abusing prescription medication, Mark has undergone seven spinal surgeries that his family is not sure he needed - seemingly to get more medication. Tracing the roots of his problems to a motorcycle accident at the age of 15 (he suffered a broken arm and whiplash), Mark claims he has been dealing with failed back syndrome ever since. Mark takes high doses of medication each day including 240 mg of dezerol, 360 mg of oxycontin, 120 mg of roxycodone and either Paxil, Xanax or Trazodone, on top of a morphine drip that he has implanted in his back. Denying his family access to his doctors or medical records, Mark admits that the amount of medication he takes would kill most people. And, on top of all these pills, Mark also steals oxycontin from his wife who is dying of Stage 4 Bone Cancer - she was given 2 months to live in December of 2004. 

Mark has agreed to speak about his life and the medication he takes.  Facing Mark in his denial is certain to be emotional and explosive - and truly the final chance for his dying wife, Carolyn, to see her husband clean.</Overview>

  <Overview>Anthony is part of a large loving family that has experienced a lot of pain. His sister overdosed on heroin and died as a result. The shock of her death has left the whole family in pieces. Anthony had been casually smoking lighter drugs at the time, but then switched to cocaine to numb the pain. He is also heavily addicted to injecting methadone, an opioid substance like morphine and heroin. He switches between the two all day and night. His father allows him to work at one of his pizzerias but does not pay him much of the time for fear that he will use the money for drugs. When he does pay him, Anthony usually always goes against his father’s wishes. Anthony’s father is desperate for him to get help and hates to see his son hooked on hard drugs. Anthony’s mother is still recovering from her daughter’s death and the anguish over Anthony’s drug use has had severe mental and physical effects on her. Many other family members, including his other siblings, uncles, and cousins have agreed to participate in this intervention in hopes that Anthony will change his destructive and deadly ways</Overview>

  <Overview>Medicine cabinets are fuller than ever today. In one port town on Florida's west coast, pharmaceutical drug abuse and its often fatal consequences are sharply on the rise, particularly among teenagers and other young people. This year, deaths from pharmaceutical drug overdoses in the area are on pace to exceed accidental deaths from car accidents. Legal drugs account for three times as many overdoses as illegal drugs - an alarming finding. Pain clinics prescribe opioids like aspirin. Meet several people whose lives have been taken over by abuse of deadly and addictive drugs, all of which are perfectly legal. We'll also meet a group of community members and experts who are taking to the streets and airwaves in the hopes of stopping this silent epidemic once and for all.</Overview>

Her husband plans to divorce her if she continues to neglect their children.</Overview>

  <Overview>The face of gambling addiction has changed, dramatically. More women are falling prey to this insidious compulsion. They often sit for hours in front of slot-machines, poker tables, or even online gaming sites--leaving children unattended and piling up staggering debts. This is no longer a game. Many of these women have gone to great lengths to hide their gambling from families, only to hit rock bottom and lose everything. Some even serve time in jail. We will go inside this compulsion, examining the shame and fear that keeps it hidden, and the surprising casualties caught up in the gamble. </Overview>

  <Overview>The episode features Chad Gerlach, clean nearly a year, in training for his first competitive cycling race (in Italy) since undergoing treatment. He has signed on with a cycling team consisting of and sponsored by recovering addicts. His relationship with his girlfriend, pregnant with their first child, is also featured. Sobriety and impending fatherhood have caused Chad to mature significantly as a person. Chad performs poorly in the race, but has recovered and matured enough to realize it's just an early step in his road to recovery.

The other half of the episode features Brooke, still struggling with abuse of prescription medications. She returned from treatment to her hometown and family and appeared to be well on the road to recovery before suffering a relapse. Eventually she is put on a different regimen of medications for her rheumatoid arthritis and undergoes knee replacement surgery, which greatly improves her mobility and obviates the need for addictive prescription medications. </Overview>

  <Overview>As a boy, Joey was subjected to his parents' divorce and subsequent remarriages. Both parents were focused primarily on their new marriages and starting new families and often neglected Joey's emotional needs. Joey entered his teens feeling rejected and abandoned by his parents, and began experimenting with marijuana and other drugs. At 19 he broke into his mother's house and stole her credit cards to finance his burgeoning heroin habit. His mother pressed charges and Joey spent a year in prison. Upon his release he entered treatment, began a successful career as a tattoo artist, met his girlfriend (also in recovery) and fathered a little girl (Lyla). Fatherhood proved to be too much pressure on Joey, however, and he relapsed. Now, Joey is seriously addicted to heroin, spending over $200 per day on the drug, is estranged from his father and has a dysfunctional relationship with his mother, and is in danger of losing his family, his home and his life to his addiction. Joey's family hopes an intervention can help him accept treatment, repair his relationship with his family and learn how to be a proper father to his little girl.</Overview>

  <Overview>After graduating college, Linda found success working as an extra in Hollywood, achieving the glamorous life she always wanted. But her dreams died when she came down with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by joint dislocations. Linda started taking fentanyl, a painkiller 100 times stronger than morphine. As her painkiller use escalated, she claimed that different sources were causing her pain, including electricity, energy, colors, and even specific people. Despite Linda's wild claims, her mother clings to the belief that Linda's pain is real and she must do everything to help her, including depleting the family's savings and sending her son to be Linda's caretaker.</Overview>

Now, Amy eats only 500 calories a day, drinks up to two bottles of vodka a night, and regularly self-mutilates. Amy's family is ready to give up on her, but they still don't know about Amy's sexual abuse. Only Amy's friend, Jessica, knows the truth, but will she have the courage to tell Amy's family before it's too late?</Overview>

  <Overview>Though he grew up in a close-knit family, Joe has felt lonely and isolated all his life. As a child, he was excluded by his peers and didn't get the affection and acceptance he needed from his father. At age eight, Joe learned &quot;the choking game,&quot; in which a person uses his hands to cut off the oxygen supply to his brain to get high. Joe loved the sensation, and secretly choked himself regularly throughout childhood as a way of dealing with his pain. In high school, Joe discovered drugs and alcohol; he began using heroin at 18 and has been addicted for the past six years. Now, living in a motel, he often steals to support his addiction, and he has been arrested and jailed several times for drug possession and theft. He has gone through treatment programs before but has always relapsed soon afterward.</Overview>

  <Overview>Gina has spent her life living in the shadow of her domineering Korean mother, and it was not until she started using heroin that she was able to escape the most painful of her memories, being blamed by her mother for having been raped. Now, with absolutely no sense of self-worth, Gina will do anything to get her fix, even at the cost of losing her son. As a young girl, Kaila, 19, was raised in an affluent, image-conscious community where she felt teased for being overweight, and overlooked by her parents. Now, at a mere 80 pounds and eating only a few hundred calories a day, Kaila is literally starving herself to death to have what she's always wanted--to be the center of her family's attention.</Overview>

  <Overview>While still a child, Zach's father was incarcerated, and Zach and his sister were adopted by their loving grandparents. When Zach's father was released from jail he moved in with the grandparents, hoping for a fresh start. It didn't take long for his father to fall off the wagon, and in fact, it was Zach's father who first introduced Zach to heroin. Using, but still functional, Zach met his girlfriend Whitney, and two years ago, she had their son. Today Zach's cocaine and heroin addiction is out of control. Whitney has turned to Intervention for help. Theresa swore she wouldn't end up like her mother who was a raging alcoholic. However, years later after several failed relationships and children, Theresa finds herself drinking uncontrollably--to the point that even cirrhosis of the liver isn't enough to make her stop. Her daughter says she's at rock bottom, close to death, and her family knows that an intervention is their last hope.</Overview>
