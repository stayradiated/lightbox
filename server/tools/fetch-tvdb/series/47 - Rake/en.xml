  <Overview>On any single day, Cleaver Greene is described as many things. Whilst his ex-wife may call him 'unreliable', his son will call him 'a mate'. To his learned friends at the bar table he is 'a real wag', to his jurors he is 'hilarious', and to most judges he is 'an outrage'. To the Tax Office, he is 'a defendant', to a certain brothel owner 'a legend', and to his former cocaine dealer 'a tragic loss'.</Overview>

  <Overview>Cleaver prepares to defend family friend Dr. Bruce Chandler, when a very incriminating DVD finds its way to the local police. Meanwhile, Barney won't speak to him, and ex-wife Wendy blames him for Fuzz's predicament, so Cleaver turns to gambling and cocaine, scoring another beating from Mick Corella's stand-over man. Then a homeless Scarlet arrives on his doorstep, followed closely by Missy railing at the realities of partner David's new political life. And when Wendy arrives looking for Fuzz, Cleaver is left reeling. A call from Joe Sandilands has Missy scurrying back to dependable David, while Cleaver seeks solace in another line of coke.</Overview>

  <Overview>Missy is on trial for murdering her fiancÃ©. The only way Cleaver can save her is to expose the conspiracy by the security apparatus Joshua humiliated. Assisted by a mysterious smoking man, he follows the money trail to ASIO, the CIA and towards information that may bring down the international banking system and several governments. Kirsty is furious that Cleaver is spending so much time with Missy, but when Col threatens to express that disapproval in the usual manner, Cleaver recognises that Col has a secret. Delirious after a mosquito-induced broken arm, Barney confesses to Scarlet that he has met someone else. Hurt and confused, Scarlet allows an innocent lunch with Harry-Sorry-David to progress down a primrose path that, with some help from Cal McGregor, will lead to perdition. Can Cleaver maintain professional standards long enough to have Missy acquitted? Will ASIO and the CIA allow him to win?</Overview>

  <Overview>When a piercing scream splits the dawn silence of a leafy, suburban arcadia Cleaver and Barney are soon defending an IT lecturer accused of severing his neighbour's penis with garden shears. Cleaver and Barney wade into the unfamiliar swamp of Rotarians, golf and backyard barbecues to uncover the truth behind the 'bobbitting'.

Barney and Nicole have failed in their attempts to end their affair, despite Nicole's approaching wedding. And even incurious Cleaver works out that the emotional rollercoasters of both Nicole and Barney are moving in sync. Only one thing could worsen their situation... Cleaver deciding to help.

Wendy is falling for Roger, the husband of Fuzz's ex-lover, while Fuzz has a surprise new girlfriend. When Cleaver attempts to cure Missy's depression at a dinner with his family, he ends up being everyone's target.
Scarlet and David are firmly on Cal McGregor's hook, but David's colleagues push him to sacrifice Scarlet to save himself. Poised between political oblivion and the dangled promise of the Opposition leadership, David, typically, prevaricates. Cal will happily fire a bullet at Scarlet in the hope it also takes out David, even better if he can wing Cleaver too. Scarlet realises there is only one lawyer devious and unethical enough to get her out from under the sword of Damocles. </Overview>

  <Overview>Scarlet and David's affair is front page news, and Scarlet faces the disapproval of the private school mothers. Barney and Nicole agree to be 'just friends' but their definitions of friendship differ somewhat. Cleaver and Missy set out to attend his father's funeral, but end up at the service for a retired travel agent. Keith Nankervis's funeral convinces Missy that life's meaning is to be found in marriage and children. However Cleaver is seeking redemption elsewhere. He attempts to recover his father's estate from swindler Lane Hole, using the talents of tabloid TV reporter Polly Nesbitt â€“ promiscuous, unethical and a chaotic force of nature. Has Cleaver met the female version of himself? And what dark paths will he be prepared to go down to get revenge?</Overview>

  <Overview>Cleaver is in prison, charged with the manslaughter of Lane Hole's sweet, elderly neighbour. He is bailed out by Missy, flush with funds since optioning the rights to her story to Hollywood. Polly Nesbitt moves on him, but has her own agenda. Kirsty will allow Cleaver to retain his extremities, if she and Col are not implicated in his trial and he pays every last cent he owes, now. Barney warns Cleaver that he will go down for manslaughter but advises he is likely to beat a murder charge. Cleaver goads Cal McGregor into having the charge upgraded, but Cal didn't get to be Attorney-General without a few devious tricks of his own. Cleaver will need the help of all his friends and several enemies if he is to escape a hefty stretch behind bars.</Overview>
