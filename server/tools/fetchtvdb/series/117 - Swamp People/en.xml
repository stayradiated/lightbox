  <Overview>Deep in the heart of Louisiana lies America's largest swamp–a million miles of inhospitable bayous, marshes and wetlands where nature rules and humans struggle to tame it. Many of its inhabitants are the hardened descendants of French refugees who were forced out of Canada in the 18th century and settled in this harsh yet majestic environment. Today, these people are known as the Cajuns, a group renowned throughout the world for their flavorful cuisine, distinctive music and vibrant culture. Resilient, self-reliant and fiercely independent, the Cajuns of the Atchafalaya Swamp still carry on many of their ancestors' trades and traditions.</Overview>

  <Overview>With new challengers on the swamp, the race to catch the biggest gators quickly has never been tougher. But more speed means more danger. Legendary Cajun Troy Landry, and his son Jacob, are struggling. Without their old sharpshooter Clint, the gator count is beginning to lag, and the boys are growing more and more frustrated. New challengers, R.J. and J. Paul, continue to blaze a trail, making their mark as prolific hunters--and threatening to steal Troy's crown. R.J. decides to move the hunt three hours away to an old honey hole. To get there--across rough terrain in remote corners of the swamp--they'll use a secret weapon: an airboat. Veteran solo hunter Bruce Mitchell is back on the swamp. As he sets out, Bruce is joined, as always, by his dog Tyler. Junior Edwards and his crew are moving at a reckless pace. They're speeding along the bayou faster than ever. But when you're moving fast...a lot can go wrong. </Overview>

  <Overview>This season, Troy has been hunting without his longtime helper Clint, and the boys have struggled, falling behind last year's pace. Determined to get back on track, Troy enlists the help of a local sharpshooter...a lady gator hunter named Liz Cavalier. Renegade Gator Hunter Bruce Mitchell hunts alone...that is if you don't count his partner/dog Tyler. Bruce and Tyler began the season solidly, racking up the gators and filling tags. It's business as usual--until, Tyler suddenly goes missing. For Joe and Tommy, the season was off to a strong start...but then, Tommy's behavior disrupted their momentum. Now, a monster gator is popping their lines, and the boys are determined to get him. As the sun sets, Terral and Trapper Agent Corey Hunt are on the trail of a large gator that's been menacing the locals. The boys scour the area to relocate the gator, and to rid the threat...before some one gets hurt. </Overview>

  <Overview>Legendary Cajun Troy Landry has hired lady gator hunter Liz Cavalier and on her first day, Liz showed her skills, but there are still a lot of gators to catch. Today, Troy's hoping to bag 25 gators, to get back on pace. R.J. and J. Paul have been making their mark as the new hunters on the swamp, and they have captured an impressive gator count so far...but all of that is about to change.

  <Overview>As a severe storm nears Southern Louisiana, the hunters are preparing for the worst. With his sharpshooter Liz still recovering from an injury, Troy and Jacob pit themselves against the gnarly weather. Troy uses an old Cajun strategy, employing a special bait to lure the gators despite the storm. Joe and Tommy are not on the same page. Tommy is looking forward to a day off, but Joe has a different work ethic. Joe is determined to run their lines in any weather, and despite protests, he drags Tommy along with him. R.J. and Jay Paul hunt in territory close to the Gulf--which means the winds are blowing even stronger. But Jay Paul isn't worried. Native Americans put a lot of stock in their dreams...and Jay Paul dreamed about catching a large gator in the storm. While the rest of the swampers head to their lines, Junior and Willie are taking theirs down. Junior is on pace to tag out in time, and he doesn't believe that fighting the storm is worth the money or effort. </Overview>

  <Overview>After being sidelined by an injury, sharpshooter Liz returns to Troy's boat. An older Creole gentleman has reported that a monster gator--nicknamed T-Rex--has killed a dog and is threatening locals. To catch him, Troy and Liz must board their own pirogue, a rickety wooden contraption ill prepared to handle a large gator. Will their pirogue handle the hunt? Bruce Mitchell has his hands full with his greenhorn helper Nick. After a ton of rookie mistakes on Nick's first day, Bruce puts Nick to the test and challenges Nick to show him what he's learned. This season, Willie is captaining his own boat--as long as he keeps filling Junior's tags. When Willie reaches his first line he realizes he's brought along the oldest shotgun in the arsenal. Willie must find a way to bag gators and fill his tags before Junior ends his days as captain. Terral Evans has the day off and sets out to catch catfish by catfish noodling--jumping into the swamp and grabbing the fish with his bare hands.</Overview>

  <Overview>After twenty days, exhaustion is setting in. For Joe LaFont, weariness is only half the battle. On a day when he needs to keep momentum rolling, his stepson Tommy's a no show. As he tackles the job alone, his luck turns from bad to worse. Weather is coming off the Gulf, and Joe will need to muster the resolve to face every obstacle the swamp has to offer. Troy Landry is focused on keeping morale and production high, but his crew is showing signs of fatigue. Jacob shows up late, and on the water, Liz is ready for some lively debate. Bruce and Nick turn to a new territory, hopeful it will provide a surge of big gators late in the season. They're after one gator in particular--nicknamed Lucifer--who dwells in an area known in Cajun lore as The Devil's Swamp. R.J. and Jay Paul are also turning to a new territory to avoid a slump. They are hunting the 3000-mile Intracoastal Waterway. It's an area known for big gators...but, it's also overrun with boat traffic. </Overview>

  <Overview>With only eight days left in the season, the old hot spots are completely fished out. To stay in the game, hunters venture into new grounds. Troy is the &quot;King of the Swamp&quot; because he always hunts with strategy. To keep ahead of the big gators, he moves his lines every 3-4 days to a new area of the swamp. Junior and Willie are headed to a new pond that is teeming with big gators. But the waters in this canal are now only three feet deep. With time running out, Junior decides to risk his boat and his engine. For Joe and Tommy, the day begins with tension on board, because Tommy didn't show up for work yesterday. As they run their lines, all are empty, and Joe believes had Tommy been at work, they would have already run these lines and moved to more populated waters. Glenn and Mitchell are always on the hunt for something the swamp has to offer. The boys are having a catfish fry for the family, but when the motor dies 4 miles from home, will they make it back in time?</Overview>

  <Overview>With only days left in the season, one team could let personal differences derail their season. After more than twenty years working together, Joe and Tommy have decided to part ways. To fill Tommy's shoes, Joe hires an up and coming hunter named Timmy. Meanwhile, Tommy decides to hire his old friend Steve. Together, the laughs are frequent, and the mood is a lot looser on board. After spending most of the season fishing apart to fill their tags, Junior and Willie are reunited on the same boat. They've decided to again join forces...and for good reason. Last night, Willie spotted a monster gator on the bayou. Nicknamed &quot;Moby,&quot; the beast could be bigger than any they've bagged this season. When R.J. and Jay Paul head to a favorite honey hole, they discover they're not alone. Duck season has begun, and this area is a favorite among duck hunters. Gunshots are ringing out all around, spooking the gators and presenting a real danger to all. </Overview>

  <Overview>After starting the season with more tags than anyone, Troy's ahead of the game, and on pace to tag out by season's end. But as Troy's crew approaches today's hot spot, things don't look promising. The landscape has changed drastically and water lilies are now clogging the entire area. Across the bayou, Joe's hunting with his new helper, and so far, the team is working well. Timmy is a pistol marksman, and his work ethic is steadily impressing Joe. Only a few miles away, Tommy is again captaining his own boat, trying to fill Joe's tags and prove he's an elite hunter. Today Tommy is intent to get down to business. But soon, engine troubles threaten to derail the day and Tommy's tenure as captain could be in jeopardy. Deep in the swamp, Glenn and Mitchell have a little time on their hands. For these brothers, that means one thing--they're ready to hunt. They're intent to cook up their Dad's Famous Squirrel and Dumplings, so they'll need to bag a mess for their pot. </Overview>

  <Overview>In the race to the finish, Troy is on pace to tag out early. But engine problems suddenly stall the hunt. Troy has no choice but to return to the dock for repairs. As Junior and Willie head to new hunting grounds, they're hopeful momentum will continue to be on their side. But when it's time to bag a beast, Junior realizes he's forgotten the guns. With little room for error, the boys now have to scramble. Bruce and Nick are down to a handful of tags. At their first line, they've got a gator hooked, but when they pull it up, they see it's been mutilated. With so few tags to waste, Bruce has to find the cannibal before his last catch is ruined. R.J. and Jay Paul have an ambitious plan to finish on time: using 2 boats, fishing 150 lines over more territory. To tag out by season's end, they'll need to catch a boatload in a hurry. Joe and Tommy have spent the last few days apart--fishing separately after a fight split them up. Today, the duo is reunited for the final push of the season. </Overview>

  <Overview>It's the final day of the season, and hunters are in a hurry to fill their remaining tags before time runs out. As Troy and Junior head to run lines for the final time, the bayou is buzzing. Locals are reporting sightings of a giant gator in the area. Both men set their sights on the beast, to win bragging rights in a bayou showdown. Just a few miles away, Junior and Willie are equally determined. As the only crew that uses treble hooks to hunt in open water, they believe they have the advantage. Across the swamp, Joe and Tommy are feeling a different kind of pressure. A storm blows in off the Gulf...and rain soaks their supply of bullets. To make matters worse, they're too far out in the bayou to head back to the dock for more. They will have to make every shot count. Down the bayou, R.J. and Jay Paul are focused on only one thing: tagging out. The boys are in good position to finish by day's end, with sunny skies and smooth water ahead.</Overview>

  <Overview>It's day one of the thirty-day alligator-hunting season in Louisiana. This year prices are 30% higher, and with big bucks on the line, a Gator Gold rush is about to begin. Troy Landry has a plan to cash in; reuniting with 20-year partner Clint and running a second boat with son Jacob at the helm. With 430 tags, more than ever before, he's determined to retain his crown. Down in Pecan Island, Troy's helper from last year, Liz Cavalier, is running her own boat this season with 260 tags of her own. Joining her is helper Kristi Broussard, a born and bred Cajun woman who's eager to show what she's got. In Houma, two-time world arm wrestling champion R.J. Molinere and his son R.J. are back. This season he's taken on 500 tags, more than anyone else, with one goal in mind...to prove that he's the king of the swamp. Swamp legend Bruce Mitchell is gearing up with plans of his own. He's got a new secret weapon, former military sharpshooter Ron Methvin.</Overview>

  <Overview>In Southern Louisiana the Gator Gold Rush is in full swing. Buyers are paying top dollar for alligators, and Troy has a plan to get his share. He’s taking a special boat called a “Gator Tail” to an old family honey hole. But when he encounters an unexpected obstacle, he risks it all to fill his boat. Junior Edwards and his son Willy are stalking an elusive beast known for his distinctive roar they call Leo The Lion. But Leo is a formidable adversary and it comes down to Leo, Willy and a pocketknife. Down at Pecan Island, Liz and her partner Kristie are taking a calculated risk of their own, hunting the canals from land to capture a monster that has been terrorizing the local population. R.J. and Jay Paul spy outsiders setting lines directly across from theirs, a direct violation of the code of the swamp. Things escalate quickly and the two-time world arm wrestling champion and his son don’t hesitate to take matters into their own hands.</Overview>

  <Overview>Tommy is on his own for the first time in his career. His step dad Joe wrecked his back while wrangling gators, so now Tommy must carry the load all by himself. Veteran Bruce Mitchell, his sidekick Tyler and their new sharpshooter Ron are hoping for another big day. To fill the boat, Bruce will move their hunt to a remote bog known as Stinky Bayou. The area earned its nickname from the methane gas that bubbles to the surface there, emitting a rotten and pungent stench. In Pecan Island, Liz and her new helper Kristi are taking a huge risk in hopes of another enormous payday. The ladies are headed to a spot that locals call &quot;Monster Marsh,&quot; home to territorial and aggressive alpha males. While veterans with hundreds of tags hunt for numbers, over in Bayou Pigeon, rookies Austyn and Blake are looking for one beast in particular. Their buyer has given them one tag to catch one huge gator that's threatening his property.</Overview>

  <Overview>As the end of week one comes to a close hunters are faced with new challenges. Troy makes a shocking discovery, a monster gator is feeding dangerously close to his home. To protect his family, he and his boys set out to do battle with the monster in a tiny boat and come face-to-face with disaster. R.J. and his son Jay Paul summon the powers of their ancestors in an ancient tribal ceremony to prepare for battle with a beast known as Big Foot. Liz and Kristie encounter something rarely seen on the swamp; a gator so bold, that he takes the bait in broad daylight right in front of them. When they attempt to haul the beast in, he breaks off the line and the battle is on! The Guist brothers find themselves in need of lumber, but they don't head to the home improvement store. Instead, they turn to the swamp, and an age-old technique of harvesting lumber as they go in search of sinker cypress.</Overview>

Before the day is done, the boys are out to fill their boat, land the King and take another step toward their own crown. Over in Pierre Part, Troy Landry's sons are out to make their own name. Last season, Jacob and his dad bagged a legendary beast known as Treebreaker. In the swamp, when one alpha male is removed, another takes his place. Jacob plots to track down the Son of Treebreaker...and step out from his own dad's shadow. Across the swamp, Junior Edwards' sons Willie and Randy are also on the hunt, working for their dad. To keep his boys focused, Junior's made a big decision: NO hook. Junior knows that it's easy to catch a bad case of &quot;treble hook fever,&quot; and spend all day looking for a target.

  <Overview>It's been the best start to alligator season in a decade, and every record has been shattered. Now, the biggest storm since Hurricane Katrina is headed straight for the swamp. Forecasters predict it will make landfall by day's end so hunters across the bayou are using every second they've got to fill as many tags as they can. After days on the sideline with a wrenched back, Joe LaFont can't stay away any longer. He and his stepson Tommy are reunited on a mission to stay ahead of the storm. Troy Landry is once again running a two-boat operation. Troy wants to catch as many gators as possible before the storm makes landfall--so he's dividing to conquer multiple territories at once. Over in Pecan Island, Liz and her helper Kristi are also looking to use a two-pronged strategy: running lines and sharp shooting in open water. Rookies Austyn and Blake have five more tags from their buyer. If they fail to fill their tags before the storm arrives, their season could be over.</Overview>

  <Overview>It's the halfway point of the month-long alligator season, and it's time to rally. Boat traffic is spoiling one of Troy's go-to hunting grounds, so he and Clint decide to brave a treacherous swamp guarded by the legendary Gates of Hell. Over in Myrtle Grove, the high water levels that remain after the storm have given Joe and Tommy a rare opportunity. Today, the guys are headed to one of Joe's daddy's favorite honey holes, located in a flooded drainage ditch they haven't been able to access in years. In Houma, today is a very special day for R.J. Molinere...it's his 50th birthday. In keeping with family tradition, the boys set a lofty goal--to catch one gator for each of RJ's 50 years. Meanwhile, Willie and Randy are facing some serious pressure from their dad, master hunter Junior Edwards. Junior's tasked his boys with a quota of six gators...and if they don't fill it, Junior will stop running their boat.</Overview>

  <Overview>As the sun rises on day 18, it's already 96 degrees on the bayou. Every hunter knows the heat drives the gators into a feeding frenzy. But the scorching sun can spoil hides and meat once the gators are in the boat. Troy and Clint are targeting Lake Verret to make the most of the voracious gators. Junior Edwards is also expecting a huge day. Five years ago, in 105-degree heat, he had the best day of his career. Today, he's hoping to repeat past glory. Liz and Kristi are primed to fill the boat by midday, and Liz is on the verge of her best catch all season. But soon, things turn on a dime when the swamp throws Liz a curve she never saw coming. Across the swamp, veteran hunter Bruce, Ron and Tyler are looking to cash in on the heat wave by targeting a hunting ground called &quot;Cypress Graveyard.&quot; It's part of local lore, and Bruce believes it will deliver, but getting there is difficult--it lies at the end of a maze of canals that can confuse even the most experienced swamper.

  <Overview>Flooding in the Mississippi Delta has raised water levels almost two feet and now the once unreachable corners of the bayou are accessible. Troy is using the high water to his advantage, riding it straight into an area that the Landry family has lived and hunted for generations, and he wants to share the trip with his son Chase. R.J. and Jay Paul will travel the flooded channels into a Houma territory that's considered sacred in their culture--once used as a burial site. Joe and Tommy are preparing to take a big gamble. The high waters have made a remote canal accessible...and despite its eerie reputation, they're going in. Back across the swamp, cousins Austyn and Blake have their own plan to make the most of the conditions. The duo head toward an area known as Dead End Bayou. In low water, the territory is blocked and unreachable. But today, high water has flooded the bank, and the rookies can cruise right in. </Overview>

  <Overview>With only 5 days left in the season, the swamp is blindsided by a cold front sweeping across Louisiana, bringing a punishing frigid rain. When temperatures drop, gators run for cover, and the hunters will have to chase them down. R.J. and Jay Paul are at a spot where R.J.'s betting gators will be on the move. But the front brings strong high winds, and their airboat isn't equipped to handle them. All season Junior Edwards has run a two-boat operation, but today he's reuniting the Edwards &quot;A&quot; Team. Willie is back at his father's side, and the duo is hoping their combined experience will help them track down gators. Bruce is anxious about the weather because his hunting grounds border Lake Pontchartrain. Even a few inches of rain can cause the lake to overflow, and force the gators to look for freshwater further inland. Troy's sons are hoping they can have a big day despite the cold front. They've got a secret weapon--a special bait to lure gators from hiding.</Overview>

  <Overview>It's down to the final 4 days and Troy's road to the crown takes an unexpected turn. A good friend and fellow hunter has passed away. When his long-time helper asks Troy to help fill their remaining tags, Troy has a dilemma. If he helps, he will have to put his own tags on hold and with so little time left in the season, it could mean that he doesn't tag out. R.J. and Jay Paul are working tirelessly to fill their bayou-best 500 tags this season. As the season enters its final days, R.J. is more focused than ever before. Willie and Randy are embarking on their last day as partners this season. Starting tomorrow, Randy has to move onto the next commercial hunting season, fishing for buffalo fish. Determined to go out with a bang, the brothers are hunting in a favorite childhood spot. Bruce's longtime sidekick Tyler isn't feeling well. With the season ticking away quickly, Bruce has no choice but to focus on the hunt, but it isn't long before worry for Tyler becomes too great to ignore. </Overview>

Complicating matters is the arrival of two new hunters who invade the Louisiana swamp from their native Texas and challenge King of the Swamp Troy Landry to a high stakes bet. The shortened season forces everyone to take bigger risks including one hunter who jumps into the water to wrestle a huge live gator that tries to get away. </Overview>

  <Overview>To win a high stakes bet against two hunters from Texas, Troy must get his sons to step up and help him bring in the biggest gator. Two of his boys head into a remote area and snag a monster with a treble hook only to be dragged around the swamp by the massive gator. Meanwhile, when one hunter's gun runs out of bullets, his partner turns to a tiny pocket knife to try and bring down a massive live gator before it attacks the boat. </Overview>

  <Overview>With the first day of gator season under way, swampers are under attack from some of the biggest and meanest gators in years. When veteran hunter Troy is forced to bring out a young teenager as his deckhand, he quickly realizes that he must calm the boy's nerves in order to fill his tags. A former nuisance hunter must capture a rogue gator that ate his father-in-law's prized hunting dog. When a seasoned hunter's deckhand is sidelined from being gator bit, he is left wondering who will be his replacement for the rest of the season. While another swamper must capture a live loggerhead turtle for a Native American ceremony to bless his upcoming gator season.</Overview>
