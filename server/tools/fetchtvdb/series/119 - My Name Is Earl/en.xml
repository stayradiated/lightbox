  <Overview>Today is the first day of the rest of Earl Hickey's life. After coming into a $100,000 scratch-off lottery ticket and losing it just as fast upon being hit by a car, Earl has an epiphany in the hospital--to make up for all the terrible things he's done in the past. With his brother Randy and a motel maid named Catalina, Earl writes up a list of every misdeed he was a part of. Earl sets out to do just that, starting with #64--Kenny James, a boy he picked on in elementary school.

Recap

When we meet Earl Hickey, he describes himself as &quot;that guy you see going into the convenience store when you stop off in that little town on the way to Grandma's house--sorta shifty looking fellow who buys a pack of smokes, a couple lotto scratchers and a tallboy at 10 in the morning.&quot; He's a petty thief who proceeds to steal some CDs and a flag from a van parked outside of the aforementioned convenience store.

Earl's narration introduces us to Joy, his unfaithful wife of, presumably, six years. He also introduces his two children (neither of which he fathered), Dodge and Earl Jr, and his brother Randy. The narration montage also introduces Darnell, an employee at Ernie's Crab Shack and also the father of Earl Jr.

This all brings us to three weeks ago. Earl gets his due in the form of a $100,000 scratch off ticket... only to promptly lose it when he runs into traffic and gets hit by a car. He wakes up in a hospital with an injured leg and neck, a morphine drip, and divorce papers from Joy. While flipping channels on the television, Earl stops on Carson Daly's late night talk show. Carson recites his philosophy on karma and it inspires an epiphany in Earl. After he's released, he and Randy get set up in a motel room, where Randy quickly makes nice with the maid, Catalina. Earl decides that he will write out a list of all of the bad things he's done and sets out to right his wrongs. He starts with #136, being a litterbug. Right after throwing away garbage in the motel parking lot, the winning lottery ticket appears at his feet. &quot;Son of a bitch, it's working!&quot;

Earl makes his way down to #64, Kenny James. He had picked on Kenny relentlessly in elementary school and has set out to make it up to him. After an incident with Kenny's parents, Randy finds out Kenny's address and the two drive off to see what they can do for him. They discover that although he has &quot;a good job as an assistant manager of the CopyHut, a powder blue LeCar he took pride in and the nicest house on the block,&quot; he has no one to share it with. Naturally, Earl sets out to get Kenny laid.

Earl pays Patty, a daytime hooker, to go to Kenny's house and have sex with him. Under the ruse of Greenpeace, Patty goes to work, only to be rejected. Earl and Randy go inside to see what the deal is, only to discover that Kenny is gay. Earl flees from Kenny's house and marks him off the list due to &quot;special circumstances.&quot;

Right after he marks Kenny off the list, his ex-wife Joy hits him over the head with a telephone in his motel room. Joy threatens him, demanding half of his $100,000 prize money. Earl writes it off as karma again and decides to take another crack at helping Kenny. Earl settles on taking Kenny to a gay bar in the city to boost his confidence. Once the three (Randy went along because Earl didn't want to be the only straight guy in a gay bar) went into the club and Kenny saw someone he liked, he realized that if Earl, the one person he's been most terrified of, will accept him for who he is then everyone else should, too. He leaves with his confidence fully intact and Earl leaves with one more entry marked off his list.

  <Overview>Back in their high school days, Earl ruined Randy's chance to score a touchdown during a key football game; now Earl must figure out a way to make things right.

Recap:

The third episode of My Name Is Earl takes a different approach then the last two. Earl adds a new quest to his list and that is getting Randy a touchdown in High school football. The story behind it is that Earl bet money that Randy's team would lose while he was playing football. Randy helped out by playing horribly, but the last play of the game, down by one touchdown, Randy finds he has the ball and starts running to the end zone. He realizes he could actually score a touchdown but chooses to fumble the ball and lose the game. Earl feels so bad about doing that he gets Randy back in to High school with the worst football team in the area.
Meanwhile Earl's ex-wife Joy has Earl's car towed, along with his money hidden under the driver's seat. When Earl and Randy go to question Joy, Randy accidentally reveals where the money is hidden. The chase is on! Earl gets to the car lot first but the people working there wont let him near the car until he pays the $3,000 in parking violations on it. Joy soon shows up and gets the same answer. So now Earl has to come up with $3,000 to get his car and lottery money back. He knows there is no way to get that much money so he has to break in and steal the car. His plan comes to him when Randy is studying up on History. The Trojan Horse, but instead a car with someone hiding in the trunk.
Joy is still trying to get the money, too. She pawns a bunch of things and gets closer to the $3,000. Earl gets his recently redeemed friend Kenny to help. Kenny's friend has a car they can use to get towed. After Earl fails to fit in the tiny trunk, Kenny offers to do it for him. This leaves Earl and Catalina free to go to Randy's Football game. He doesn't score a touchdown until the final play of the game, in the huddle of the team, Randy says to give the ball to him. They hike and hand the ball off to him and he starts to run for the end zone. He is almost there and he tries to kick the ball over his head and catch it as he walks in to the end zone, but he fumbles and the other team recovers. Earl can't believe and neither can Randy. He's so depressed he walks off the field slowly.
As Earl and Catalina try to find Randy and wait for Kenny to return, Joy drives by. She has the $3,000 and is on her way to get Earl's car. Earl tries to run after her but after about 15 steps stops. Out of breath. Things look bad for Earl but just then he sees his car driving down the road and Randy's driving it. Earl is dumbfounded. Randy explains to him he bet $3,000 they'd lose the football game. So he had purposely fumbled, losing the game. He used the money to get Earl's car back. Thing is, Earl wanted Randy to get that touchdown, but Randy explains he cared about Earl and his needs more then a touchdown. Very heart filing episode.

Randy and Earl tag along a bit, but Earl realizes he can't do this anymore. After Ralph steals stuff from a store, takes a bridal dress and throws all his beer cans in the apartment complex's pool, Earl decides he has to tell Ralph about the List and his changed ways. So he takes all of Ralph's stolen stuff and cleans up the pool.

While cleaning the pool, Joy shows up and tells Earl he can't teach English anymore. She explains that one of Earl's students has a nail business next door to Joy's nail business. The only reason people go to Joy is because she speaks English so she doesn't want Earl's students to learn. Just then Ralph walks in and hears them talking about the List. Ralph questions Earl and he has to explain everything. Ralph doesn't really pay attention until Earl mentions the $100,000 he won. Ralph decides to give Karma a chance and he cleans up.

Soon after, Ralph gets a job and an apartment room next door to Randy and Earl. He starts working at a Lamp Store. Earl is proud of Ralph until he sees that he's been stealing lamps from the store. He decides not to be friends with Ralph anymore because he still steals. Randy starts to hangout with Ralph more then Earl and tells him that it's his List and he has nothing to do with it. Meanwhile, Earl teaches his that &quot;One block right then two blocks left&quot; is how to get to his house. Back at Joy's trailer where she has her nail business, she is teaching Earl's student to speak English. Too bad she is really teaching her to say disgusting things so she loses all her customers. When Earl is back at his room he gets a phone call from Ralph telling him that while Randy and him were stealing from a house, Randy got stuck in a chimney. Earl goes to help them out, but it was just a trick to get Earl to leave.

Ralph hits Randy over the head with a lamp after he comes out of the bathroom and ties him up. When Randy comes to, he finds himself in Earl's room with Ralph ripping the place apart. He wants Randy to tell him where Earl puts his money. Randy doesn't tell Ralph until he drags him in the shower and sprays hot water on his &quot;goods&quot;. Randy tells him that the money is in a safe box at the bank and Earl has the only key. Just then, Earl decides to head back to his room because he can't find Randy in any chimneys. He walks in his room, sees Randy tied up and gets smashed in the head by a lamp, courtesy of Ralph. When Earl regains consciousness, Randy explains that Ralph took his key and his heading to the bank to steal his money.

Randy apologizes to Earl for hanging out with Ralph even after he stole things and that Karma is punishing him for it. He tells Earl to call out to Karma and see if it helps them. Earl thinks it's silly but does it anyway. After calling out several times, his door opens and his English class walks in. They said there was no class so they went &quot;1 block right then 2 blocks left&quot; and came to Earl's house. Earl quickly calls the police who are waiting for Ralph when he shows up at the bank. He manages to run away from them. Earl takes his class out to eat for saving him and Randy. Another check off the List. Just then Ralph walks in and gives Earl his key back. He apologizes for what he did and Earl rightfully forgives him.

  <Overview>In order to replace a fancy figurine that he broke, Earl lends a hand to help Joy's former adversary and her daughter win a mother/daughter beauty pageant . However, Joy enters the pageant also with her &quot;dead&quot; mother trying to win that same figurine, hoping to trade it for a hot tub.

Recap:

The episode begins with Randy sitting down at the bar. Earl walks in and hands a cereal box to Randy. He looks very happy. Earl tells Randy no more generic cereal for him. He only gets the best now.

When Earl and Randy get back to the apartment, Joy is there digging through all of their stuff. Earl tells Joy she isn't getting any of his money. She tells him that all she really wants his a hot tub. Earl looks on his list and sees that Joy his on it. He tells her that he will fix that so she'll leave him alone. It says that he blew up Joy's Trophy but he can't really remember what it was for. Later that night he dreams about it. Randy and him are using firecrackers to blow stuff up. They run out of things so Earl brings Joy's trophy. It is a little girl sitting on a lawnmower with the companies name on it.

The next day Earl goes to the company and asks if he can have one of the trophies. The lady there tells him that the trophies are given out to the winners of the Lawn Mower companies Mother and Daughter beauty pageant. The lady remembers when Joy won. The next year a new mother and daughter entered and that family has won every year since. Their name is the Stokers. Earl goes to the mother and daughter and asks if he can have one of their trophies. They make a deal that if Earl helps them win this year, they will give him the trophy. Earl tells Joy he is going to enter and win her a trophy. She doesn't want him to so she is going to enter, too.

The beauty pageant is also has a talent show part. The reason this family has won every year is because they have a &quot;gift&quot; in which they can throw knives with amazing accuracy. Earl is placed on a large circle which spins around while Ms. Stoker and her daughter throws knives at him. Earl finds out that the daughter, Candy, has been practicing with plastic knives and she hasn't discovered her &quot;gift&quot; yet. This greatly worries Earl. Ms. Stoker gives Candy real knives and has her try it. She does perfectly, a great relief to Earl.

Later, when Earl is alone with Candy, she tells him that she really wants to become a doctor and not enter these beauty pageants. Earl convinces her that she has to do it for him. Meanwhile, Joy goes out and tries to adopt a child, with little luck. So she calls her mother and asks if she will enter with her, but has no luck either. Joy gets an idea. Crabman and her smoke a ton of cigarettes and fill up a urn. She convinces the judges at the pageant it is her mother's ashes and they allow her to enter.

While all this is going on, Randy and Catalina hang out and get to know each other better. The pageant begins and the competition is fierce. After a first couple of groups go, Joy comes out. She is wearing a skimpy two-piece swimsuit carrying her mother's urn. She sings some songs and even starts tap dancing. She really wants to win this pageant. The Stoker family is about to come out and Earl is getting ready. Backstage, he sees Candy and she looks depressed. He talks to her and sees that she is unhappy. He tells her to hit him in the leg with the knife.

The Stoker family comes out along with Earl. Ms. Stoker goes first and does a perfect job. Candy steps up, throws the knife and it flies right in to Earl's leg! Earl gives Candy a thumbs up to let her know he's ok, aside from a knife in his leg. He tells her he is ok and that he has been stabbed by plenty of girls. The judges come out and announce that Joy is the winner. She gets a trophy and Earl realizes that he did the right thing. Joy got her trophy back and he can cross her off his list.

  <Overview>Earl tries to cross of number four off his list “Blew dad’s chance to be elected mayor”. Four years earlier, Carl Hickey ran for mayor to redirect a proposed airplane traffic route over his house and away from the wealthy part of town. Earl unfortunately ruins any chances of his father winning when caught in on tape assaulting a police officer.  Earl must now help his father get elected and mend his relationship with his father.


Recap:

It begins with hearing Earl talking to himself that he is not too eager to Cross Number 86 off his list, which is: 'Stealing a Car from a 'One-legged Girl' Well but he overcomes his fear and goes to her house. He tries to explain, she curses at him and then her no-legged, but fitted with prosthetic legs, boyfriend runs after him, and as we know the Hickey Boys aren't that fast, so he catches up with him and beats him with a sign which he takes as a hint from &quot;Karma&quot; that he should be somewhere else that day. He thinks about that while getting beaten with a sign which says &quot;Marty Park for Mayor&quot;. Which brings him to Number 4 on his list: &quot;Blew Dad's Chance to get elected Mayor.&quot; For this you have to know that Earls father always complained about things and never did anything about it. But when they put the airplane route right above his neighborhood he decided to run for Mayor. In the course of that you see Earl and his brother always getting into trouble, first as children and then as young adults and their father always bailing them out of jail. But then he stopped bailing Earl out. But his opponent used the bad sons, more so Earl than Randy against him and thereby causing him to lose the election. They didn't talk since then. Well, so much for the past. Now, trying to make things right, Earl signs him up to run for Mayor again. And even finds new voters to register. But when, due to Randy's fault, the Voter Registrations are flying out of the Car and due to a misunderstanding with the Police while trying to pick up the voter registrations Earl lands himself in Jail. All this is caught on Tape and this tape is later used by his opponent which causes Earl's Dad to lose again. Well this is the first episode with an open end, because Earl can't cross his Dad off the List. But at the end of the episode Dad comes to Jail and when they get out of the Station, his Dad (excellent performance by Beau Bridges) says: &quot;I expect you to pay me back that bail money&quot; and Earl is happy because his Father hasn't bailed him out in over 6 Years. Then at the very end of the episode it seems they will be a family again, first you hear a short monologue by Earl, and you think like &quot;It's not gonna work&quot;, but then you see their parents at home again (which you did a couple of times during this episode) and Dad says: &quot;You know I ran into John Sheppard down at the Street and he said that Earl came by and paid for a Window that he broke 15 years ago&quot; Mom answers &quot;Really?&quot; and Dad goes &quot;Ya&quot;. Then an airplane flies over the house again, messing all the picture frames hanging on the wall, as it happened so many times in this episode. But after this short conversation you get the feeling that there will be some closure, but it's gonna take a lot of effort on Earls Side. After this you see Earl and his brother going too sleep, but Earls brother has an important question for Earl, which is, if he could be any animal in the world which would he be? Earl answers him that he'd be a dog because they are allowed to be inside and they are also allowed to sit on the couch. Then there is a short thing about cats but I don't wanna get into that. Randy, by the way, wanted to be a Monkey but decided that Earl made a good point about point about the couch. So, what's gonna happen to Earl and his parents?

  <Overview>As the holiday season comes under way a few secrets are exposed when Earl attempts to cross number seventy-four off of his list: &quot;always ruined Joy's Christmas.&quot; Earl, Randy, and Catalina enter a radio contest to win a brand new car for Joy to make up for all of the thoughtless Christmas presents Earl gave her while they were married. While Randy and Catalina vie over the car, Earl finds out that Joy's parents believe that he's still their son-in-law and that he's just returned from the war in Iraq. Joy is afraid to tell her father, an alleged racist, that she is now married to Darnell, so Earl plays the part, afraid of ruining another one of her Christmases.


Recap:

Of course this episode is again about doing things right, but with a little difference: This time there are other people too who, well didn't do all bad things BUT they all have secrets.
This episode begins with a contest. The contest consists of the following. You have to keep at least one hand on the Car which you can win at all times. (I think it's a Dodge Neon.. but I am not sure), Why does Earl want to win the contest when he got a perfectly fine '73 Al Camino with nice '77 Door and a 1987 Camero Transmission.? Of course! It's for the List! Number 74: 'Always ruined Joys Christmas'. You see a few examples. 2002: He gives her something that looks like empty shell casings and gets asked: What shall I use them for? And he says: Whatever you like.
2003: She gets flavored condoms
2004: She gets Keys and says: &quot;Wait, these are my keys?&quot; and he says: &quot;Yes, I found them&quot; (Very funny moment in this episode).
Well, we are back at the contest. His brothers asks: &quot;What does she need a new car for, she already has one&quot; After that you see a extremely funny scene (and a little sad) where she and Darnell get out of the car .. and you see the two children in the back in the middle of the rain. And that kinda makes the point for earl. Back at the contest. Just when it began Earl shakes Randy's hand, and as this was his only hand on the car, Earl is out. But just moments before Catalina showed up, so there are supposedly two people working for Earl. Earl remarks that he has to do something anyway. Once again (as you so often do) you see a flashback. You see Earl and Randy in front of the TV with a LOT and I mean A LOT of Beer Cans. They talk about that they have no more. Then Joy comes out and asks if the Kids Bikes are already assembled. Well since they both (Earl and Randy) decide, that they are too wasted to drive they decide to drive. So they take the kids bikes. Earl monologues:&quot;I learned a valuable lesson this night: If you try to fly a big you better make sure that E.T. is on the back and not a 12-pack of Beer&quot;. On the next day of the flashback you see the kids with their broken bikes and Earl remarks &quot;You must have been bad this year&quot;&quot; and receives a, well let's call it, not very nice look of Joy. Back at present time. Earl went over to Joy wanting to ask what color the kids might like for the bikes and when he opened the doors he gets greeted by Joys Parents: Buzz and Connie Darville and as Earl remarks: Business owners. Then you see a cheap commercial about them selling their water beds, but I am not gonna go into that now. (That would take too much time). Well then something strange happens: First Buzz says: &quot;Welcome back Soldier&quot; and then as Joy appears and sees Earl she jumps him and says: &quot;Coming back from Iraq, just in time for the Holidays&quot;. She lets herself be carried in the Bedroom. There she explains that her father is a racist (he wouldn't even let her go to some school show with a black boy) and that, if he knew she would be disinherited. And she explains that her mother is in a wheelchair because she has advanced arthritis and kidney failure, so she has to get dialysis. Well since Earl doesn't want to ruin her Christmas again. While this was going on Randy and Catalina were the only two people left in the competition. But Catalina makes it clear that, if she wins this car.. She's gonna keep it. On this day Earl goes to Joy's asking what color the kids bike should be like and he catches Joy's mother walking.. That's the second lie he's uncovered so far. She explains: First, that she has a gambling problem. She is faking her Kidney failure to get money for her gambling. And as for the wheelchair: She had a little accident and got used to being pushed in the wheelchair, then she remarks:&quot;Don't you judge me&quot; And don't ruin Christmas. And that gets him every time. So he is keeping her Secret. Back to the contest: Catalina and Randy are the last two contestants. Finally Catalina wins and her secret is revealed: She is not a U.S. citizen, so Randy wins by default. But folks, the episode is far from over but it seems that all the pieces are falling into place. Well almost, next you see Earl decorating the tree and then you see Connie (Joys Mother) , getting into the newly won car (Which is supposed to be Earls gift for Joy and to make this possible Randy's gift for Earl). Earl catches up with her and she says: &quot;I am going to the Indian Casino, don't you judge me&quot;. Earl takes one of the bikes again and just catches up to her on her way back where she tells him that she bet on the whole car on no. seven (in Roulette). And she tells him once again not to judge her. When they arrive at hom Joy and her father are catching them. So she tells everything. Like that she used the dialysis money for gambling or the whole money of the business and then the whole card house begins to crumble. Darnell appears and Earl tells the father to call Darnell Son (which the father takes literally and believes he is one of his sons until told otherwise)... It unfolds that Joys father LOVES African-American people. Which was the reason he didn't want Joy to go out with an African-American back in her schooldays.. He was her half-brother. They argued the rest of the night, everyone thinking everyone others secret is worse than their own. But in the morning when the children came and saw their presents and were happy the family went back to be happy too.
It seems that they all only kept their secrets because they didn't want to lose everyone else. No there were no more secrets and Joy had her first happy Christmas in years. So Earl can cross another thing of his list and move on.

  <Overview>When trying to enroll her children into the Right Choice Ranch for troubled youth, Joy is denied enrollment because of a barn burning incident at the hands of a younger Earl. Earl, Randy and Catalina travel to the camp to make amends for the barn burning by building a pen for the camp’s ostrich.  Earl learns the real reason behind the barn burning incident and decides that every incident on his list after the fire should be shared by Randy.


Recap:

The episode begins as we find Randy playing the crane game in the Crab Shack. There is a live rat inside, and Randy wins it. Unfortunately, he gets bitten as it was having it's way with Grover when Randy so rudely pulled it out. Joy complains to Darnell about the kids, saying they are even too bad to visit the &quot;Right Choice Ranch&quot;, a place where Earl and Randy went as kids. Darnell says he is busy, but Joy reminds him that he's only delivering crabs, not doing a transplantectomy.

Earl doesn't want to deal with the kids and tries to avoid Joy, but the Ranch is on his list - he burned a barn down throwing away a cigarette. He decides to go, and tries to keep it a secret because Randy is afraid of birds. When asked where they are going, Earl only offers that &quot;they do not have funnel cakes.&quot; Upon arrival, Randy cunningly tries to avoid the birds at the Ranch (but ends up playing dead and begs two children to call the cops) while Earl volunteers to help build an ostrich pen.

After seeing how much the kids enjoyed seeing his good example (and Catalina), Earl realizes that if he hadn't burned down the barn, Randy would probably have a better life. Earl decides to add Randy to the list, but Randy isn't happy about that. After some arguing, a mishap lands a nail through Earl's hand. We remember Randy's fear of blood, and he admits that it was his fault the barn burned down. Turns out he dropped an oil lamp by the still lit cigarette after a bird scared him.

Earl realizes that Randy is responsible for everything - including all the bad things on the list that Earl did since 1982. The list is now his. While Randy starts to do Earl's list - including trying to return a stolen birdbath, sleeping with two of a man's wives, and stealing donuts from a bank - Earl relaxes as he feels he is on vacation.

But then Randy comes up with one he can't do - Earl promised Joy's kids that he would take them to Mystery Fun Land. Randy can't sign the kids out of &quot;Bad Kid Camp&quot;, so Earl has to do it, while he makes Randy begin to scrape chewed gum from under every table he ever sat at. But Earl finds out that Mystery Fun Land is now gone. He doesn't know how to fix the problem, but the kids forgive him. This inspires Earl to forgive Randy for burning down the barn, and he takes his list back.

  <Overview>When Earl and Randy try to return a stolen wallet they find out taking the money had cost two newlyweds their honeymoon. In an attempt to make things right Earl takes over for the groom at his fast food restaurant. After time Earl finds out the boss is a jerk and Earl wonders how such a man with a luxurious house and beautiful wife could not be affected by the only thing he believes in, Karma.


Recap:

Earl and Randy wake up one cold morning at the hotel, Catalina alludes to the fact that they may be being carbon monoxide poisoned and leaves the room. Randy discovers that Earl was right when he said Randy &quot;wasn't ready for a pet&quot; after discovering dead &quot;Mr. Fishy&quot; (the goldfish) in a sealed plastic bag in his pocket. Earl however discovers number 202 on his list, &quot;stole a wallet from a guy at a gas station.&quot; 

We flash back to &quot;a few years ago&quot; when Earl was &quot;hanging out in a gas station bathroom, waiting for some guy to drop his pants and provide me with an opportunity.&quot; Earl screams a little too loud and a little too enthusiastically when he discovers just how much money is in the wallet and has to cover by announcing to the bathroom that &quot;they have my favorite brand of toilet paper in here, soft stuff.&quot;

Earl admits to having stolen a lot of wallets in his day, but also admits that this particular one was the mother load. And, it seems when you find yourself with a lot of money you go to Jasper's. What is Jasper's you may well ask? &quot;Jasper&quot;s is kind of like the mall, only it's in a storage unit and everything there was stolen from the mall.&quot; The gang spends the thousand dollars they had on many things that day and according to Earl, they were living like kings. But back to today, when faced with the reality of having to give up his helmet bought that day long ago, Randy asks Earl why he can't just give the guy back his wallet with a thousand dollars of his lottery money stuffed in it. Earl explains to Randy that the items were bought with stolen money and, as such, have bad Karma all over them. 

The slushee machine represents one small hurdle, since it now home to Darnel's turtle. But typical &quot;Crabman&quot; accommodation, Darnel decides to allow the turtle to simply go &quot;free range&quot; on the carpet of the trailer. Joy barely looks up from her magazine when announcing &quot;if that thing starts begging at the table, its going to become an outside turtle.&quot; 

Back at Jasper's to return the items, Randy and Earl discover that Jasper has gone &quot;high-tech&quot; complete with taking orders online and a mail-order Russian wife. With the money in hand (and we never quite learn how they are able to get back all their money, even though the items have been well used), Randy and Earl track down the owner of the wallet. The intention of course, is to return the wallet and then Earl can simply cross the item off his list. 

As with every item so far from Earl's list, nothing is quite so simple. The scene where the wife of the man whose wallet was stolen opens her tanning bed calling the boys thief's is hilarious as Randy recoils from her over-tanned stick like figure asking &quot;what is that Earl, what is that?&quot; When the wife wants to call the police, Randy cuts the phone cord, briefly making the wife feel that she and her husband will die. After some explaining, Earl finally manages to calm them down. It seems however that the money stolen was for the young couple's honeymoon. And so simply returning the money will not be enough for Earl to cross them off the list. 

Earl agrees to cover for Jeff at his job, while he and his wife go off on their &quot;do-over&quot; honeymoon. The fast food restaurant is run by a Mr. Patrick who we quickly come to find is a real tyrant to work for. Earl has never done well with authority and in the past when faced with this type of person, the answer was simple, Earl would just punch him in the face and feel much better. We even get to watch via a flash-back as Earl quits four past jobs using this very method. Alas, with Karma now dictating his actions, Earl is not able to vent the way he would like and even winds up eating a disgusting french-fry which was used to wipe the groove on a counter Earl had supposedly cleaned. What Earl won't do for Karma! He isn't made to feel much better by the co-worker who tries to console him by saying &quot;that's ok, I had to eat a hamburger patty he wiped on a toilet seat.&quot;

Earl has to endure more humiliation from Mr. Patrick and he bears up well, fully firm in his belief that Karma will make sure this terrible manager will get what's coming to him. Just when you think Earl has put up with enough, Joy and Darnel pull up to the drive-thru window. Joy decides this situation is far too much fun to enjoy from the car and decides to park and come on in. 

It starts the minute Joy walks up to the counter and says to Earl &quot;well look at you all dressed up in that cute uniform and they even had your extra dorkey.&quot; Earl may no longer punch abusive managers in the face, but he will fire back at Joy, and does &quot;welcome to Stars, may I take your order? And your clothes look stupid too.&quot; Joy convinces the manager to give her the food she ordered for free, claiming Earl's hair had fallen into it. Earl allows himself to be compelled to wear a hair net on his head and one for his moustache that crosses his face. While totally not enjoying the experience, he reminds himself that Karma will look after the bad people in this world.

While loading Star's paid for toilet paper to drive over to Mr. Patrick's house for his own personal use, Earl meets again with a female co-worker (Zeena). While trying to explain the &quot;uncontrollable, driving force&quot; behind Karma, Zeena misunderstands where he is going with this, and in a very awkward moment blurts out, &quot;I love you too Earl!&quot; and while taking out her retainer adds, &quot;you'll be my first.&quot; 

Earl first begins to question what Karma is doing when observes that Mr. Patrick has a beautiful house in a beautiful neighbourhood and a beautiful wife, all of which he clearly didn't deserve. Once inside the house, the situation is only made more frustrating for poor Earl. Mr. Patrick seems to have it all. O Karma, where art thou?

Back at the hotel with Randy, Earl tries to make sense of it all. When Catalina suggests that maybe Mr. Patrick is nice outside of work, Earl announces &quot;even if he pulled his face off and underneath was that guy from U2 who does all that charity, he still wouldn't deserve a wife that hot!&quot; Earl spends the next day at work looking for some sign that Karma is on the job, but all he finds are more and more incidents where Mr. Patrick clearly violates all Karma's principles with apparently no repercussions. In one totally hilarious moment, Earl decides that Mr. Patrick must be being punished by Karma in a way that requires &quot;up close&quot; observation. Earl recounts, while standing beside Mr. Patrick at the urinal &quot;I didn't want to check there, but I had to.&quot; From Earl's reaction we can quickly ascertain that Karma has not punished Mr. Patrick &quot;there&quot; either. You will have to watch the episode to see the scene where Earl says he's &quot;having a little trouble working up a stream&quot; and how Mr. Patrick &quot;helps&quot; him. Too funny to try and write about.

Back on the job, dressed as a hamburger for child's birthday party, Earl complains &quot;I could see that Karma wasn't punishing Mr. Patrick, what I didn't get was why it was punishing me.&quot; The children and Mr. Patrick plague Earl, but Mr. Patrick really berates Earl and through it all, Earl tries to simply &quot;power through it&quot; and not respond as he dearly wants to. Just when you think that Earl might actually stay calm, he unleashes the fury of his punch and drops Mr. Patrick to the floor with a punch to his eye. I, for one, jumped up and yelled in appreciation. When Zeena gets in the action and starts to kick Mr. Patrick on the floor, Earl intervenes and tells her to take it easy. One of the best lines of the show is Zeena's &quot;oh god, your hands on my body, feel so right.&quot; 

Earl says he &quot;felt bad for sending Mr. Patrick to the emergency room, but when I found what I started, I felt even worse.&quot; One by one, all the things in Mr. Patrick's world unravel and a man who once had pride in his collection of &quot;world's best …&quot; mugs, is found in a prison cell with a tin mug labelled &quot;world's best bottom.&quot; It is a bad turn for a bad man, but Earl feels guilty since it was his fists that brought the punishment, not Karma's. Randy accurately points out that &quot;Karma doesn't have fists&quot; and goes on &quot;Karma doesn't have hands at all, or feet&quot; he pauses, then asks tentatively to Earl &quot;does Karma have feet?&quot; Earl decides that maybe Karma did use him to do the dirty work, especially since a bad man (Mr. Patrick) got what he deserved and a good man (Jeff) got promoted to manager. 

&quot;In the end, everyone got what they deserved and I was able to cross number 202 off my list.&quot;

  <Overview>Earl crosses another number off the list when he returns Pops’ Weiner Hot Dog cart he and Ralph (Giovanni Ribisi) stole in his youth. The good deed does not last long as Ralph, who works for a competing franchise sets fire to Pops cart. Earl now must set things right with a bizarre plan while recruiting Randy, Joy, Catalina and Darnell to assist him.


Recap:

After going out to eat, Earl remembers that he and Ralph stole Pop's Wiener Hot Dog cart because the competing fast food restaurant manager pay then to do it. So he decided to take it of his list. 
Earl when to the place where he hide the cart and went to Pop's house to returned and ask for forgiveness, Pop agree to forgive him. But it was not enough because now people are used to go to the fast food restaurant and nobody goes to Pop's anymore. Earl decided to advertise Pop's to get him back to business and he succeeds.
But after Pop's got back to business Ralph burns Pop's cart because once again he got paid by the competing franchise.
Earl decided that now he owe Pop a new cart so now he had to get money to buy one. He decided to get the gang together once more to plan for a new hit. While planning Ralph came up with the idea of cutting his finger and put it in the food of a restaurant and sue them, Earl dismiss the idea.
He planned to get them all work in a company and steal all they could from it to get the money. Thanks to Kenny, Earl makes all the gang look qualify for the job (Kenny exchange his test with them making him look bad and them good). After all got the job, they hide and wait for the night to act.
At night, they started to steal everything but then Ralph came up with stealing a huge copy machine everybody didn't wanted to do it but Earl thought that the machine would make the money quicker and decided to go for it. 
They went inside the room with the huge machine and try to carry it through the door but it was to big to fit, Ralph insisted in pushing it harder but it got them trap inside the small room. The next morning they all were fired.
Earl was about to give up when Ralph again brings up the idea of the finger, but this time he brought the finger too, so Earl decided to go for it. Joy was in charge of finding the finger and sue the restaurant, she quickly got the money and give it to Earl, she didn't care about the money, she was happy that the gang was together again, Pop's got his cart again and Earl could write it off his list.

  <Overview>Earl's attempt to give Joy the hot tub she's always wanted backfires and she is forced to stay in a makeshift bubble because of a flesh eating toe infection. While she is out of commission, Earl must fill in as the new Joy. Between gossiping with the ladies at the salon and shopping for meat out of some guy's trunk, Earl learns about the Turner family. This includes the fact that Dodge and Earl Jr. might have a social disorder that causes them to have no friends. Can Earl fix this problem too? </Overview>

  <Overview>To cross Jerry (guest star Jerry Van Dyke) off of his list, Earl can't just return the RV he stole, mostly because Randy blew it up. Earl and Randy set out to find what might make this grumpy war hero happy, and accidentally turn him into a 75-year-old killing machine. Elsewhere, Joy and Darnell attempt to turn the legend of a giant pig that lives near the trailer park into a one-of-a-kind, money making sideshow. </Overview>

  <Overview>To cross Randy off his list, Earl takes his brother to cheerleading camp. Once there, the tight cheer pants and their lack of flexibility are not their only problem. They also have to deal with Kimmi Himmler (guest star Jenna Elfman), the camp owner with a deeply scarred face and milky eye - both a result of a badger accident suffered while cheering in high school. When Himmler wants the brothers out of her camp, Earl goes to drastic measure to make sure that Randy's cheerleading dreams will come true. Elsewhere, Joy is hurt when her son Dodge indicates that Catalina is the most beautiful woman in Camden.</Overview>

  <Overview>Randy busts into the motel room, demanding that Earl drive to Joy's and punch her in the face. Over time, Randy has invested lots of time and money in the Crab Shack's claw machine, but every time he wins a cute stuffed animal, Joy bullies him into giving it to her. This last time he won a fancy bird dressed up for a wedding and the loss has put Randy over the edge. Earl points out that Randy is 32 years old, and it's time he learned to stick up for himself - Earl's not going to protect him anymore.</Overview>
