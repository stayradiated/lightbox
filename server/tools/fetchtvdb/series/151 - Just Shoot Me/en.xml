  <Overview>The show follows the staff at the fictional fashion magazine Blush. The show originally centered on Maya Gallo, played by Laura San Giacomo, a feminist writer, who reluctantly takes a job at the glamour magazine, owned by her father, the Donald Trump-like Jack Gallo played by George Segal (who in the story has a rivalry with Donald Trump). The cast includes womanizing (and usually over-sensitive) photographer Elliot DiMauro (Enrico Colantoni), and the heavy drinking and sexually promiscuous ex-model Nina Van Horn (Wendie Malick).</Overview>

  <Overview>Out of work and out of money, Maya is forced to ask for a job from the one person in the world she least wants to work for- her father Jack. When she gets there, she has to face some unexpected competition from Jack's current employees: fashion editor Nina, who fears Maya will squeeze her out of her job, secretary Finch, who fears Maya's presence will diminish his influence with Jack, and head photographer Elliott, who hates having to put up with Maya's resentment of his attitude toward women. The biggest obstacle of all proves to be Maya's own pride and her hatred of all Jack and Blush stand for.</Overview>

  <Overview>Maya's attempts to get her coworkers involved in her favorite charity are met with overwhelming indifference. Only after the PR-minded Jack goads them to help to Finch, Elliott, and Nina contribute. And only after Maya pleads with him does Jack finally contribute. Rather than giving his time or effort to the charity, he helps in the usual Jack Gallo fashion- by giving a giant check for $50,000. When he consequently wins an award for Humanitarian of the Year, Maya's jealousy gets the better of her. Meanwhile, Elliott tries to figure out why the office's nickname-happy gopher keeps snubbing him.</Overview>

The recipient turns out to be night custodian Jesus Santos, whom Maya meets while working late one night. Things become extremely awkward when Jesus decides what to spend the money on- nothing but presents for Maya. Meanwhile, Finch conspires to get Elliott to let him tag along on his trip to the Caribbean for a Christmas photo shoot with five gorgeous models.</Overview>

  <Overview>When his favorite high school teacher dies, Elliott at first sees the memorial service as an opportunity to flaunt his flashy career and his glamorous lifestyle in his old classmates' faces. His cockiness is quickly tempered, however, by the revelation of the truth about his high school years- he was something of a nerd. When the office hears about it, his present becomes almost as intolerable as his past. Meanwhile, Jack trains Finch in the art of being influential around the office.</Overview>

  <Overview>A surprise visit from his fireman father leaves Finch puzzled, since the two had always been emotionally distant from one another. When Red Finch suggests that he and his son spend some quality time together, Finch can only surmise that his father is either dying or having an affair. The truth turns out to be even more shocking- Red has finally come to accept the fact that his son is gay. He isn't, of course, but Finch has a hard time convincing him of that. Meanwhile, Maya invites Jack to her apartment to dinner in order to convince him that the neighborhood she lives in is not as bad as he thinks, but a robbery there that afternoon complicates the task.</Overview>

  <Overview>When Maya scores an interview with legendary rocker Nick Hewitt, a flood of memories is triggered for Nina of the affair they had 25 years ago. Nina describes it as the most romantic weekend of her life, and she realized he felt the same way when the song &quot;&quot;Nina in the Cantina&quot;&quot; hit the charts a few months later. Unfortunately, Maya learns that the song was actually about Twiggy, and Hewitt only used the name Nina for the purpose of the rhyme. Worse, he doesn't remember Nina at all, leaving Maya to engineer a big charade to keep Nina from getting hurt. Meanwhile, Elliott's extreme jealousy of Annie Liebowitz is exploited everywhere he turns, while Finch tries desperately to get rid of an ugly handmade vase given to him by Jack.</Overview>

  <Overview>It all starts out innocently. In order to help Elliott get a great deal on an apartment, Maya agrees to pose with him as a married couple. To complete the charade, the two are forced to kiss. This development is harmless enough- until they find themselves kissing again voluntarily. Awkward could hardly begin to describe relations between them afterward. They work through the awkwardness, but by the end, both Maya and Elliott realize that the long, bumpy road, wherever it may lead, is just beginning for them. Meanwhile, when Jack discovers Finch has been renting out his parking space, it leads the two into a battle over trust.</Overview>

Having his territory infringed on soon becomes the least of Finch's worries, as Kenny threatens Finch violently when Finch speaks up. To make matters worse, no one believes Finch because Kenny is all brightness and sunshine to everyone else. Meanwhile, Nina's attempts to quit smoking backfire in two ways: Nina becomes even more amorous than usual toward everyone, while Maya, mistaking Nina's nicotine patch for a Band-Aid, gets unwittingly hopped up on nicotine and becomes relentlessly hyper.</Overview>

  <Overview>While writing his memoirs, Jack suddenly contracts a horrible case of writer's block. He then realizes why- he has come to the place in his memoirs where he fired his old partner Herb just before Blush took off. Discovering that his old partner has been toiling in a toyshop in Connecticut for 30 years earning a meager living only worsens the guilt. In an attempt to make it up to him, Jack gives Herb a high position in the magazine only to rediscover the reason he let Herb go in the first place- Herb is terrible at the magazine business. Meanwhile, Nina's problems with an IRS audit seem to be over when the female auditor takes a liking to Elliott, but in fact, they're just beginning.</Overview>

  <Overview>When Jack sends Maya in his place to an NYU forum on Women in the Media, she sees it as an opportunity to speak up for the viewpoints that Blush often tends to push by the wayside. Unfortunately, she never gets the chance, as the forum turns out to be an ambush, where Maya is crucified for Blush's negative portrayal of women. She ends up lashing out at everyone at Blush, but things only become worse when her comments find their way into NYU's campus newspaper, which Finch promptly distributes at the office. Soon afterward, the truth is discovered- Jack knew all along what would happen at the forum, and it's left up to Maya to turn the tables. Meanwhile, Nina attempts to stage a comeback by posing in head-to-toe gold body paint for Elliott, but her constant sniping at the photo shoot annoys Elliott so much that he pretends to be out of the solvent required to remove the paint, leaving Nina to walk around golden for a few days.</Overview>

  <Overview>An ordinary office blood drive turns into a storytelling session, as Finch, Elliott, and Nina relate to queasy donor Maya and nurse   Tisha the tales of how Jack rescued them from rather desperate situations. Finch applied his shiftiness to a job as movie usher   before the manager fired him for trying to sneak a customer into a sold-out show. Luckily, the customer, Jack Gallo, took notice of his methods. Elliott was a down-and-out amateur photographer reduced to selling his output on the street and faced with the   prospect of taking a job at a grocery store in New Jersey, but in the nick of time, his talent was noticed by a patron named Jack   Gallo. Finally, Nina had come a long way from her successful modeling career--she wore a mermaid suit at a boat show before   someone stopped by who remembered her keen fashion sense--none other than Jack Gallo.</Overview>

Also, a heartfelt confession of Elliott's (he sometimes wishes he was a woman) during the guys' emotional viewing of Brian's Song comes back to haunt him.</Overview>

  <Overview>When Maya's first love John Kenny pops back into town, she becomes as happy as she's ever been, as the two find their old spark back in full force. However, Jack is angry about the whole thing, as he still has not forgotten when he walked in on the two of them fooling around one time. Maya then learns the true horror of the situation- the only reason they were separated in the first place was because Jack had pulled strings to get him into the Royal Shakespeare Company, and she becomes instantly fearful that he will once again begin to interfere with their relationship. Meanwhile, Finch uses a &quot;&quot;tough love&quot;&quot; method to train a new intern while Nina's television appearance is ruined when an old allergy acts up.</Overview>

Elliott wants to ditch the party for an Armani gala being held on the same night, Nina shows up with Maya's old boyfriend Derek, Jack wants to wear Elliott's costume, Finch is trying to make time with the caterer (who is dressed as a large-bosomed French chambermaid), and gamemaster Larry is a down-on-his-luck actor who spends most of the party on the phone with his agent.

As a result, Elliott believes that Persky has given him a really cool video game system, and Maya has given him a box of kinky sex toys. When Maya invites him over that night to have some fun, he naturally gets the wrong impression, and is forced to give his relationship with her some deep thought. Meanwhile, when the racehorse Jack bought with Robert Goulet acts up before the big race, he enlists Nina's aid to calm it down.</Overview>

  <Overview>Maya's enrollment in a photography class causes problems on multiple levels between her and Elliott. Elliott takes an immediate dislike to Maya's teacher, Martin Spancer, when he insults Elliott's work for being too commercial. Then when he assigns Maya to do a nude self-portrait, Elliott claims that he only gave her the assignment so that he could see her naked body. Believing that Elliott's accusation is based on his personal dislike for Spancer, she disregards him. However, when Spancer raves about her nude photos and invites her to go away with him for a special weekend session, Elliott becomes even more convinced that his intentions are purely sexual. Meanwhile, Finch becomes extremely jealous when Nina's new assistant Brad begins entertaining Jack with magic tricks.</Overview>

  <Overview>Finch is very frustrated when an old nemesis, Barry, shows up one day to gloat over his success. Not only does Barry own a successful business, but he is also engaged to their high school homecoming queen. Finch agrees to a double date with Barry and his fiancÃ©e, and he wants desperately to show Barry up by scoring a better looking date. He finds his answer in the form of Adrienne, a gorgeous supermodel. Adrienne would normally be way out of Finch's league, but by manipulating her many insecurities, he makes her fall for him. However, he still has one more obstacle to overcome-Adrienne's ex-boyfriend has decided he wants her back. Finch is forced to take desperate action if he wants to hold on to her, and does-he asks Adrienne to marry him, and surprisingly enough, she says yes. Meanwhile, Jack makes plans to have his photo taken in front of a new painting in his office, but unfortunately, he doesn't realize that the painting depicts an obscene act.</Overview>

  <Overview>Finch announces the engagement at the office, but it takes several minutes to make everyone believe it. When they finally do, though, it begins a heated argument between Maya and Elliott over whether Finch's and Adrienne's love is for real. It may not matter either way, though, because once the news of the engagement spreads, Adrienne's ex-boyfriend Brian shows up at Blush with plans to beat up Finch. Finch manages to avoid Brian temporarily, but the incident forces him to speed things up yet again-with a wedding that very day. Finch and Adrienne are married after Brian punches Finch. But...Elliott and Maya are also married while looking for Finch in a mass wedding.</Overview>

  <Overview>Finch and Adrienne return from a wonderful honeymoon in Tahiti, but upon their return, Finch is hit with a hard dose of reality. If he is to maintain his &quot;&quot;cool&quot;&quot; image in Adrienne's eyes, he will have to give up a lot of his favorite things, such as action figures, sci-fi conventions, and cat shows. What makes this so problematic is that his cat Spartacus has just made the finals of a big cat show, and winning has been a lifelong dream of his. Meanwhile, Maya and Elliott fret over whether their marriage is legal or not and end up seeking out the help of the cult's strange lawyer, Larry. Larry successfully annuls the marriage, but the two are left still unsure about the possible future implications of the whole affair.</Overview>

  <Overview>A planned Blush article on lost loves leads everyone to reminisce about their own lost loves. The saddest story belongs to Elliott, who saw his dream girl sail out of his life when a hit and run driver knocked him down on his way to propose to her. The story has an extra meaning for another person, however. When Elliott describes the incident, Nina realizes that she was the driver in question. Meanwhile, Finch wants desperately to convince the world that he is actually married to Adrienne, so to help him out, Jack takes out a big wedding announcement in the New York Post. Unfortunately, the attention it draws is of the unwelcome variety: an INS agent arrives at the office charging that the marriage is a sham. And why does it matter what the INS thinks? Because it turns out that Adrienne is actually a Canadian citizen whose work visa has just expired.</Overview>

  <Overview>A few weeks have passed since Elliott and Kaylene started dating, and the two are starting to get extremely close. A little too close, as far as Elliott is concerned. Things are moving very quickly between them, and Elliott just doesn't feel like he can commit that deeply to her. He and Maya start chatting about it in his studio one night, and instantly, the spark between them returns. Before they realize it, Maya and Elliott are finally sleeping together. Maya wastes no time in chastising herself for it the next day. She claims that Elliott sleeping with her was only the result of his fear of committing to Kaylene, and that she now occupies a position she had previously treated with scorn and ridicule -- that of the &quot;&quot;other woman&quot;&quot;. Elliott doesn't see it that way.  He tries to tell her so, but she won't listen. He finally breaks things off with Kaylene, explaining that he's in love with someone else, and that even though that someone won't have him, he can't go on seeing Kaylene feelin</Overview>

  <Overview>Nina's long time friend Binnie unexpectedly dies, and Nina has a hard time dealing with it until Elliot confronts her. From ignoring her death, Nina takes a weird turn to worshiping and hanging out with her urn, until she loses her friend's ashes. Meanwhile, Jack has a new pet: a mini-computerized egg that will do almost everything Finch does, causing him a great deal of jealousy. Finch then decides it's time for him to do something that will take him to the higher steps of life and go to college â€“ through the Gallo Foundation Scholarship, that is. Unfortunately, Maya is there to bring the good sense down to her father, and he ends up giving the scholarship to someone who really deserved it: the eastern European cleaning lady's grandson.</Overview>

The entire male staff of Blush is drooling over her, and Nina warns Maya about Amy, but she thinks Amy is not just another dumb blond bimbo. Amy tries to show Maya some articles she has written, hoping that they would end up published in the magazine, but Maya thinks their content doesn't go with the Blush's theme. Nevertheless, Amy goes over Maya's head and shows the articles to Jack, who makes her Blush's newest sex columnist. Maya, who was just convinced to fire her because Amy was not at all what she thought, is shocked.

  <Overview>Finch and Elliot are fighting over Amy. Jack warns Amy that the fight is interfering with the office work environment, and so Finch and Elliot come to terms about Amy: they decide that since they both like her so much, they should share her, meaning she would spend half her time with one and then the other half with the other. Of course Amy is not ok with that and decides to quit the magazine altogether since she got a six figure book deal. Meanwhile, Jack and Nina try hard to show Kevin the good of being rich and end up corrupting him. Now Kevin, who was once happy and simple, is miserable and full of debts.</Overview>

He comes over to her place to watch some more movies, but Jay brings porn and Maya kicks him out for good. Meanwhile, Jack encourages Finch to take some useful classes in college, so Dennis takes on TV Production. He starts his own show - &quot;Finch Attack!&quot; - and asks Elliot to be his first guest. Halfway through the interview, he literally attacks Elliot and tapes him to the chair. After apologizing, Dennis convinces Elliot to help him attack Jack, but instead they both attack Elliot again.</Overview>

  <Overview>At Vicki's suggestion, Jack asks all the Blush staff regulars to anonymously evaluate his work.  Finch, Nina, Maya, and Elliott submit signed appraisals that only include words of praise, while Vicki anonymously tells Jack the truth.  By process of elimination, Jack knows who the criticism came from, and he is spurned.  Vicki consoles him and finally convinces him that the truth is healthy.  Jack then insists that everyone tell him something honest, which sends Finch into a tailspin of vitriolic criticism.
Meanwhile, Nina sprains her ankle after Maya suggests she   walk somewhere, and Maya has to take Nina's place at a fashion event.   When Maya has a great time, Nina becomes jealous.</Overview>

First up, hairstyling once again occupies Vicki (Rena Sofer), who's &quot;&quot;dyeing&quot;&quot; to give Blush the brush; Nina takes under her wing the female impersonator who's portraying her in a cabaret show; and Dennis rides roughshod over his new assistant---Elliott.</Overview>
