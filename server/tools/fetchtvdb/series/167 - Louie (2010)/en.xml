  <Overview>During a stand up routine, Louie discusses serious topics such as child abuse and abduction. In the first segment, Louie goes to a new dentist who's afraid of dentists himself and specializes in calming patients fears. Louie is anesthetized and provided with middle eastern music. While under, he dreams about speaking with Osama Bin Laden and a group of terrorists. The group discuss ethics and the 9/11 attacks. Louie then dreams that the dentist is putting a banana in his mouth. When he wakes up he finds the dentist frantically zipping his pants, implying that Louie was orally raped. While performing stand up, Louie discusses the intricacies of male sexuality. In a second segment, he attempts to court a black woman named Tarese who works at the local grocery store. After buying groceries, Louie buys the woman flowers (from the same store), checks out at her register, and then gives the flowers to her. Tarese calls the manager to complain and the manager reimburses Louie for the flowers. Louie is waiting for the woman when she gets off of work, and walks home with her. Although Tarese is openly not interested, Louie walks with her to her apartment, where he is turned down. He then meets her sister as she is leaving the apartment complex. The next scene shows the two performing coitus. In a closing stand up segment, Louie professes his love for Jewish women.</Overview>

  <Overview>In the first part of the episode, Louie awkwardly scores a &quot;non-date&quot; with a young woman who has no real interest in him, but a shocking and violent encounter on his way to meet her for a movie leads to a darker, more introspective Louie that appeals to her—until he tells her the specifics of that encounter. In the second part, Louie is approached by his daughter's classmate's mom to have an emotionless sexual encounter; he agrees to do it, and comes to regret that decision every step of the way.</Overview>

  <Overview>Louie and his daughters take a long drive to visit Louie's great aunt Ellen out in rural Pennsylvania, where Louie mostly ignores his younger daughters' complaints of boredom and has a blast rocking out to &quot;Who Are You?&quot;. There, they find her actions and vocabulary weird, specifically her use of the word nigger, referring to Brazil nuts as niggertoes. Louie decides he wants his daughters to talk to Ellen without any censoring, but the point becomes moot when she collapses and dies in her kitchen. Louie then does a stand-up bit about Tom Sawyer being a good kid and Huckleberry Finn a bigoted little jerk. </Overview>

  <Overview>Louie starts his evening with a surreal trip on the NYC subway, where he witnesses a busker playing beautiful violin music while a filthy homeless man scrubs himself down with bottled water nearby, has a black-and-white vision of himself saving the riders from a soda-soaked seat, and then heads into the opening credits. Later, he meets his friend Pamela for lunch, and he ends up passionately telling her how he feels about her. And she doesn't respond at first, leaving him to misread a later invitation of hers, and the revelation ends with Louie standing outside her building and screaming in pain and anger. </Overview>

  <Overview>The episode begins in a flashback with Louie filming the pilot for a sitcom. After complaining about the unrealistic dialogue and use of Bob Saget as the next door neighbor, Louie is shown arriving home to an unseen and presumably upset wife and their newborn baby Lilly. The episode then jumps to Lilly's tenth birthday. Louie sets out to obtain Lady GaGa concert tickets as a birthday present for his daughter, but doing so means he has to approach Dane Cook, a very successful comedian who is upset by accusations he has stolen material from Louie. </Overview>

  <Overview>The spokeswoman for a group called Christians Against Masturbation, Ellen Farber, and Louie have a debate about the morality of masturbation on a the FOX News program, Red Eye w/Greg Gutfeld. Louie is the only person they could find willing to openly defend masturbation. After the show Louie goes home and masturbates while imagining a woman he had just seen on the elevator. Then, at Ellen's request, he attends a CAM meeting, and goes out for drinks with her after. She invites him up to her suite, but Louie is denied when he tries to go in for a kiss. Ellen gives a long passionate speech about how nice it would be to talk, date a long time before a kiss (but not &quot;making out&quot;), then finally getting to see her in her underwear on their wedding night. Then he goes to her suite bathroom to masturbate. </Overview>

  <Overview>After a set, Louie is greeted by Eddie Mack, a fellow comedian who started his career the same time as Louie but has never found much success and lives in his broken-down car. He and Eddie catch up after not seeing each other for 20 years by going to the liquor store and then an open mic where Eddie does a very funny routine under the stage name &quot;Shitty Fat Tits&quot; before Eddie confesses his plans to end his own life, leaving Louie to ponder how (or if) to dissuade him. </Overview>

  <Overview>Louie waits at Grand Central Station to pick up his sister and niece for a visit. However, his sister surprises him by dumping the niece Amy on him and running off to catch a train to Philadelphia. Louie and Amy spend the night in New York together, visiting an indie rock club at her request, after which she asks to see Louie perform. After seeing her enamored with Godfrey's set, Louie attempts, unsuccessfully, to impress his niece by doing crowd work. After the set, Louie is surprised to see Godfrey spark up a lively conversation with the usually sullen teen. When they arrive back at the apartment, Louie receives a call from a Philadelphia hospital informing him that Amy's mother was found &quot;acting irrationally&quot; in a public fountain and that she is being held under observation. With Amy's father out of the picture, Louie volunteers to keep Amy until his sister is released. </Overview>

  <Overview>Louie continues his efforts to earn the Late Show hosting job. He is visibly moved by his daughters' support for his goal, but continues to be confounded by Jack Dall, who gives Louie a &quot;make me laugh right now&quot; ultimatum he barely passes and then has him do a practice interview with an emotional cleaning woman. Louie makes it to an actual test show in front of a packed audience, where Jack wishes him well and gives him some advice that pays off when Jerry Seinfeld tells Louie he's already signed a deal to take over for David Letterman and Louie would be nice to keep it a secret. Louie recognizes Jerry is lying and goes out and absolutely crushes his test show, mixing genial humor with some raunchier material and hilarious interviews with Susan Sarandon and Paul Rudd. Lars Tardigan loves the footage and says &quot;We've got an option!&quot; That night, Louie gathers with his comedian friends for the news, but Doug shows up looking downcast just as Maria Menounos announces that David Letterman re-upped for another 10 years and has even worse news: Louie is now persona non grata forever with Letterman. A devastated Louie barely avoids breaking down, but he also appreciates that he at least cost Letterman a ton of money on his new contract, lets the Letterman show know that they never broke him, and returns to Alphonse's gym to continue his boxing education. </Overview>
