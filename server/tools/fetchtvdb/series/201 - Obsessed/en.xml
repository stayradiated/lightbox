  <Overview>Christa's OCD prevents her from eating most foods for fear they are contaminated. To ease her anxiety, she spends hours in front of the mirror with a pair of tweezers ruthlessly tearing into her skin, mostly her face. Christa is completely reliant upon her fianc√© Shawn, but he doesn't know how much more he can take. She is afraid that she'll end up dead or homeless because no one will want to deal with her anymore. Meanwhile, Ryan feels like a slave to his OCD rituals of checking, tapping and counting. His morning routine is riddled with grooming rituals around showering, getting ready, and leaving the house. He even makes his pregnant wife participate in his compulsions. Through cognitive behavioral therapy, Christa and Ryan will try to overcome their obsessions.</Overview>

  <Overview>Mandi is a costume designer for a TV series, but she doesn't have hair. Mandi began pulling her hair out when she was nine. She wears wigs, but her ability to hide her bald patches only increases her pulling episodes. Meanwhile, Mora constantly brushes and cleans her teeth. If her anxiety is raised during the day, she'll call her dentist to schedule an emergency appointment, which has resulted in eight root canals in the last several years. Even her eating habits are influenced by the damage certain foods could potentially do to her teeth. Mora's OCD contributed to her impending divorce and she fears that if she doesn't gain control over it soon, it could negatively impact her 7 year-old daughter. Both Mandi and Mora are at the end of their rope, and hope that CBT can help them find their way back.</Overview>
