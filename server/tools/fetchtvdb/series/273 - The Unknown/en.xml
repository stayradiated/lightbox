  <Overview>Originally planned as a pilot for a new television series to be called The Unknown, it was filmed with two different endings and was allotted double the normal production time. In the pilot version:
Andre reveals there is no Thanatos plant, and was thus not dead; the time tilter did not in fact work; Hobart was not dead but merely in a coma; and lastly, Kassia uses the pistol to kill Hobart, thinking he is attacking Leonora.
The other, more well-known version was shot for &quot;Outer Limits&quot; as episode &quot;The Form of Things Unknown.&quot;

Note the credits animation style and music were reused for THE INVADERS scifi series. The music soundtrack by Dominic Frontiere is available from Lalaland.com, paired with another good score for the film &quot;A Name for Evil.&quot;</Overview>

  <Overview>Near Aix-les-Bains (South-East of France), two women, Kassia and Leonora, are driven by a fanatical blackmailer, named André, in a white Rolls Royce at full speed. Suddenly, they stop near a lake, in the middle of the woods, where the man decides to have a swim. He asks the two women for a drink. The women plan to assassinate him by introducing a deadly leaf from a Thanatos tree in the cocktail. The man dies by poisoning and drowning and the women stare at him without moving. They put the dead body in the trunk of the fancy car. Later, they've lost their way in the countryside and, finally, find a mansion where an old blind man, Colas, opens the door. Upstairs, a strange inventor, Tone Hobart, built a time machine which could resurrect the dead. Unfortunately, André is now alive and ready for a revenge.</Overview>
