  <Overview>Sarah Lund officially joins the investigation into the murders of Anne Dragsholm and soldier Allan Myg Poulsen, who was found butchered in a warehouse. A published video of the captive Dragsholm suggests the assassinations are acts of terrorism, and the police look into links with Islamic extremists. At Parliament the case puts new minister Buch's terrorism legislation in jeopardy when the government's right-wing partners demand a tighter grip on extremism. Prisoner Jens Peter Raben takes matters into his own hands after being denied parole. </Overview>

  <Overview>The murder of another former soldier, David Grüner, prompts inquiries into his and Raben's army squad and a particular event during the group's Afghanistan mission a few years before. Lund and Strange track down one of the remaining members in a remote Swedish island. Buch is under pressure from above to cave to the right wing's demands about banning Islamic organisations, but new information about former minister Monberg's relationship with one of the victims makes him weary of acting too hastily. </Overview>

  <Overview>After the dramatic death of the deputy public prosecutor, it is clear that Emilie Zeuthen's kidnapper is a man who will stop at nothing to recover a debt. But what is this debt? Lund and Borch are trying to get cooperation, and Lund tries to get Mark to reconcile with her. The family Zeuthen find it hard to accept that Emilie is gone, and press the police to act by making all resources available. Prime Minister Kampers staff are trying to keep him free of the kidnapping affair, but they have some unpleasant information, which makes it difficult to focus on the election campaign.</Overview>

  <Overview>Another failed exchange attempt puts Borch and Lund in a dilemma: should they obey the perpetrator, or act despite his directives - and thereby risk putting Emilie Zeuthen life further at risk? The coroner's death suggests several things now that there is a relationship between an old murder and Emilie Zeuthen's fate. Robert Zeuthen is ready to pay the ultimate price to get his daughter back alive, and despite police warnings, forces through his will. The Prime Minister's political life is linked more and more with an unsolved police matter, and Minister of Justice and PET cannot provide clarity. Opposition leader Ussing takes every opportunity to accuse Kamper of responsibility for Emilie Zeuthen's disappearance.</Overview>

  <Overview>The perpetrator continues to talk about a debt that he will have met and if Sarah Lund is to save Emilie's life, she must find out which debt he's talking about, and how it should be paid. The perpetrator has this time asked for Robert Zeuthen in exchange for Emilie - the exchange is in progress. Robert Zeuthen is now on the way, along with Lund, to sacrifice his life for his daughter, while Maja follows the drama from Police Headquarters, where Brix tries to get a handle on the situation. The Minister of Justice proves to be crooked, and the same applies to Anders Ussing. Their possible connection to the old murder gives Kamper reason for serious considerations, and he makes a dramatic decision, much to the frustration of both 'stoffer and Karen.</Overview>

  <Overview>Borch has got Lund back on track in the case of Emilie, and they're now working with Asbjørn looking for signs of life. They follow in the perpetrator's tracks, who obviously has gone to Jutland looking for something, but what? They make an eerie discovery, and expose themselves to danger. At the same time Lund and Borch are faced with a dilemma. The pressure on Brix grows at police headquarters, as management ask questions about his judgment. Robert and Maja find it hard to believe that their daughter is dead, but they try both to deal with the debilitating grief that has befallen them. Preparations for the funeral begin. Prime Minister Kamper struggles with his decision, because he understands that doubts have arisen about Emilie's fate, but the Minister of Finance is not easy to convince. Ussing turns out to have a secret that gives Kamper new faith that he can regain the party's trust.</Overview>
