  <Overview>Responding to a robbery complaint, Webster and Gillis arrive at the building and enter into a criminal-chase. Thinking he is being fired at, Gillis returns gunshots. He strikes one of the criminals, David Palmer, only to find out that the teen is unarmed and now gravely injured. Gillis is overcome with guilt. An inquest is scheduled until the teen dies on the operating table. Gillis, on mandatory leave from the Police Squad, attends David Palmer's funeral, observing from a distance. Later that evening, Gillis receives the first of several anonymous phone calls informing him that he did not kill David Palmer; the Squad, consequently, begins further investigation. In reenacting the crime they discover that a third bullet was fired (from the gun of one of the escaped teens), which caused the fatal wound of David Palmer. The two other criminals are caught searching for the third bullet, and it is Gillis who convinces them to surrender, thereby restoring his honor.</Overview>

  <Overview>Assigned with the task of protecting a valuable witness, Danko and the Officers must exercise caution regarding visitors to the prison. When a professional killer disguises himself as a professor seeing to interview Sol (the witness), Danko denies him the opportunity. Nevertheless, Danko does agree to help the 'professor' by accompanying him to an aircraft hanger where he claims he is meeting a friend. At the hanger, the killer reveals his true intention: to force Danko to wear deadly explosives while he holds the trigger, forcing the Police Force to negotiate Sol. Both Sol and the police refuse to compromise until a visit from Jill ultimately convinces Sol to help out. The Squad devises a plan that appears favorable to the killer but actually leads to his murder and Danko's safe release.</Overview>

  <Overview>In an effort to prove he's no 'old man', Officer Danko chases down a fleeing criminal. While he succeeds in apprehending the thief, his partners Webster and Gillis fail to catch the criminal's brother, who is also running from the law. Danko testifies in court against the criminal he caught, thereby infuriating the brother who is unassumingly observing in the courtroom. Consequently, he begins to terrorize Danko's wife, Jill, with mysterious phone calls. Not wanting to upset her husband, Jill confides in his co-officers. When Danko finds out, he is confronted with the issue of whether or not to change his testimony in court, to appease the terrorizing felon and save he and his wife. What follows includes a climactic car-chase ending with the inevitable arrest of the second criminal.</Overview>
