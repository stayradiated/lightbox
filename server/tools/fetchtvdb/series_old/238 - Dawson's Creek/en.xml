  <Overview>As the WB commercial says... &quot;Children must pay for the sins of their fathers.&quot;
Dawson sees Mr. Potter dealing drugs and he is unsure whether or not to tell Joey or leave things looking good. Mr. Witter has to stake out the Ice House because the Capeside police department believes that Mr. Potter is back to his usual tricks. When the gang is studying in the Ice House, one of Mr. Potter's customers lights it on fire, making Mr. Witter more suspicious and Dawson's conflict greater. Gail tells Mitch about her new job offer in Chicago and her discussion to go for it. Pacey becomes depressed and his achievement level decreases, now that Andie is gone, which his father teases him for. Finally Mr. Witter does realize her importance and that he has been a bad father. Jack becomes worried that Jen is suicidal when she doesn't immediately leave the burning Ice House. But later, Grams and Jen reconcile, causing Jen to move back in taking Jack also.</Overview>

After Andie comes home from the hospital, her dad tells her it would be better if she went to spend the rest of the year in Italy with her aunt, since she already has the credits required to an early graduation. Andie decides to go and plans a goodbye dinner with the whole gang. She tells them how important life is, and the valuable time they might be wasting with useless fights between natural best friends.

Pacey doesn't like the idea, so when he and Gretchen go on a road trip to her ex boyfriend's house to pick up her truck, Pacey tries to get them back together.

  <Overview>Pacey offers to cook for the gang on their weekly dinner (an event they always plan on doing but always fail to). Jen and Dawson return early and decide to keep what happened between them, but they are caught by everyone making out at the door. The dinner goes on in a very awkward way for everyone as Audrey and Dawson worry about Joey. But surprisingly she seems to be fine with it. Charlie also drops by, causing some tension for Dawson. At the end, they all decide that keeping their long lasting friendships is more important than having a weekly dinner, and Joey confesses to Pacey how she really feels about the whole Dawson-Jen thing.</Overview>

  <Overview>It's Dawson's first day in his new film school. Oliver (the somewhat obnoxious filmmaker Dawson met on the film festival) starts showing him around and wastes no time in asking Dawson to direct a movie he wrote. Reluctant to direct someone else's work, Dawson starts giving notes to Oliver on the script, and ends up accepting the job, thanks to Jen's incentive. Jen, on the other hand, is having some problems of her own. Her current state of happiness from the wonderful relationship with Dawson is reflecting on her on-air performance. Now she has to go back to the sharp-tongued, edgy advices she used to give instead of the romantic, love-themed ones. Meanwhile, Elliot finally has the courage to ask Joey out, but Joey makes second plans for a gathering with professor Wilder. She makes a fake excuse not to go out with Elliot, and her evening takes an unexpected turn when she and professor Wilder kiss. Elsewhere, Jack is reprehended by his brothers for being on academic probation. Irritated</Overview>

  <Overview>Directing Oliver's movie is not an easy task. First, Dawson has to deal with Audrey's (who took the leading part) complaints about Oliver's kissing skills. Then he has to recast the other lead role after watching the footage and discovering that Oliver stinks as an actor. Now they have to find someone who can act, is hot, charismatic in less then 6 hours. They can't think of anyone but Charlie, who fits the profile like a glove (for Jen's desperation). During the shooting Audrey has a crisis and locks herself in the bathroom because she kissed Pacey and felt like she was betraying her best. They have to call Joey (who was over at Professor Wilder's house to solve their issue) for help, and after her blessing Audrey is back on the set so they can finally finish the shooting. Meanwhile, Jack is fed up with his brothers and decides to move out of the fraternity house after he and Eric have a moment and later Eric accuses him of trying to kiss him to the other guys.</Overview>

  <Overview>Oliver tells Dawson he's arranged a screening for their movie, which is yet to be finished. Dawson freaks out, but Joey comforts him saying the movie is brilliant. Everybody attends to the screening and solve their conflicts while waiting for it to start. Dawson meets a handful woman, and after exchanging insults she reveals herself to be Amy Lloyd, movie critic for Boston Weekly, whom Oliver secretly invited for the screening. She storms out of the theater, and it's up to Dawson to bring her back. They go out for coffee, have a heart-to-heart talk and even make out! Meanwhile, Joey is scared about her feelings towards Charlie and goes to Jen for advice. Jen says it doesn't matter if the guy is a jerk; at the end of her life there might always be a Clifton Smalls (the new African American boyfriend of Grams). Pacey asks Audrey how many men she's slept with, and she tests him by saying 27, then 57, when it was really only 5. Pacey passes the test and tells Audrey he's in love with her.</Overview>

  <Overview>Pacey's new boss proposes more professionalism in the workplace and promises to leave behind her attraction towards him, even offering Audrey her job back. Audrey suspects something is going on between them and refuses to return to Civilization. Later, Alex drops by at Pacey's and Audrey walks on them talking about their kiss. She storms out in anger, leaving the future of their relationship unknown while Pacey struggles with the growing attraction he feels for Alex. Meanwhile, Dawson runs into Amy Lloyd, the movie critic, and they end up in bed together. After sex, they talk about movies and she lends him her movie. Joey and Jack focus on studies, and while she has problems concentrating, he has to catch up an entire semester and even goes back to the fraternity house asking for help. Luckily, Eric (the same guy that caused Jack his expulsion) shows up at Grams with the needed notes.</Overview>

  <Overview>Joey's worst nightmare comes true when she accidentally sends a very personal e-mail she wrote for Dawson to the entire student body. The next morning, Joey's e-mail is the topic of virtually all campus discussions when Professor Hetson decides to debate it with his students.  Meanwhile, Jack makes an attempt to get to know his cultural professor, Mark Freeman, who pays no attention to Jack, a little better.  Pacey, while struggling to survive the first days on his new job, closes a very important deal for the firm, which his wheeling-dealing mentor Rich Rinaldi takes full credit for.  Eddie, a student in Joey's reading class, whom also works as the bartender at Helle's Kitchen, persuades Joey to confront any challenge that Hetson throws and not show any weakness since Hetson thrives on it.</Overview>

  <Overview>In Los Angeles, while directing re-shoots on &quot;Wicked Dead&quot;, Dawson finds his authority questioned by Heather Tracey and the other producers when Natasha refuses to do a nude scene. As a result, Dawson adopts an aggressive take-no-prisoners attitude, similar to the one that Todd has, to take control of the situation.  In Boston, Joey is unable to say good-bye to Eddie who is moving to California to register at a college when she convinces him to help her take Audrey to a rehab clinic in Los Angeles, and the three of them, plus a guy Audrey picks up, drive cross country where the four constantly quarrel with each other.  Also, Jen and C.J. set a lonely Grams up with C.J.'s Uncle Bill, who turns out to be quite randy.</Overview>
