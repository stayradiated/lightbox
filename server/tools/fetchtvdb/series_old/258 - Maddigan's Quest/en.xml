Continuing, the Fantasia find a small settlement, where they can get food and medical help in exchange for a show. At camp, Garland meets two strange boys, who seem to be being pursued by two men. Who are these boys, and what do they want?

  <Overview>After passing a small settlement, Tane and Jewel fall ill with a deadly plague, soon followed by Goneril and Eden. Maddie and Yves suggest that in order to complete their mission, the Fantasia must split; the healthy continuing to Newton, the sick staying behind. Travelling onwards, however, Garland realises that with the help of the silver girl, she may be able to help Goneril, Tane, Eden and Jewel. Returning to them, she convinces Boomer and Timon to come with her to a place called ‘Apothecary – Nidus’. Can they find a cure here? And will they be able to evade Ozul and Maska again?</Overview>

  <Overview>Finally arriving at Newton, the Fantasia find an impostor claiming to be from Solis and trying to obtain the solar converter. They are also pelted with tomatoes, by the children of Newton, who seem to control everything. Being fed up of being bossed around, Lilith joins them and their leader, Bolek. Timon seems to know a lot about Newton, and Bolek, and Garland tries to discover what he is hiding. Earth tremors then shake the complex, and put everyone in danger, especially the children who are in their Fort. Will the Fantasia actually be able to obtain the solar converter?</Overview>

  <Overview>On the journey back to Solis, the Fantasia are diverted from their route because of landmines. They must now travel through Urukopaina – radioactive tunnels of the dead. Guided by the Tunnellers, hopelessly mutated humans who can tunnel like moles, they make their journey through the passageways. What they don’t know, however, is that the landmines were planted by Ozul and Maska, who wished them to travel through Urukopaina – as such, the Fantasia face many dangers underground.</Overview>

  <Overview>Now travelling on areas off their map, Yves wins a map of the area including Solis from some friendly travellers. They follow it, but find it to be incorrect, leading them to the sea. They are soon caught by the travellers they met earlier, who turn out to be Flesh-Pirates – the women and girls will be sent to Manland, whilst the men and boys are sent to work in the jip-mines. However, they also want the converter, and Timon and Eden, for some tradesmen they have met. This leads to a terrifying ordeal for Timon – how will he, or the rest of the Fantasia, escape?</Overview>

  <Overview>Whilst resting, the Fantasia are attacked by flying Birdboys. Their food is stolen, but more importantly the solar converter goes missing. The Birdboys’ camp is searched, but the converter is not found. Garland suggests that Ozul and Maska must be nearby, but Timon suggests something altogether more worrying – that Yves could have taken it. Yves is accused of treason to the Fantasia, but is Timon right? Is he hiding something himself?</Overview>

  <Overview>The Fantasia reach Pilgrim’s Vantage – a point which overlooks Solis – six weeks before the solstice. They party and celebrate, but Garland sees how Maddie and Yves have become closer, and this fuels her longing for her Father, Ferdy. Right on cue, Timon gives her an opportunity – to use the slider, go back in time and save Ferdy. Eden dislikes the idea, and the Silver Girl begs Garland not to do it, but with Timon’s persuading and seeing her mother and Yves together, she agrees. Do they succeed in saving Ferdy? Are Timon’s motives for wanting to go back authentic?</Overview>

  <Overview>With only one day left to reach Solis, chances of success for Solis seem non-existent. The Fantasia have no trucks, and thus no way of making it in time. Bannister, however, returns to the Fantasia, and is able to lend Maddie and Yves his van. They now have the opportunity to make it to Solis, but on arrival, they meet a Duke of Solis, who will later on become the Nennog. What will come of them? What has happened to Jewel? Has Timon really been stopped? Is it all too late for Solis?</Overview>
