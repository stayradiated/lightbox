  <Overview>Shawn told Sami that he and the rest of the family were behind her, no matter what. In an aside, Marlena told Sami that John knew that she knew about the affair, and she was going to tell Roman. John balked, as he worried how it would make Roman feel, but Marlena said she couldn't continue to force her own daughter to lie for her, and that this was too hard on her. Roman later thanked John for being such a wonderful friend and talked about his love for Isabella, but all John could feel was guilt that he had betrayed his 'friend' by sleeping with his wife.
At the Titan party, Laura entertained fantasies of strangling Kate. Dressed as a man to avoid being recognized, Vivian begged Laura not to do anything yet...she had the perfect revenge in mind, but revenge needs planning. Laura finally relented, and agreed to take the anti-psychotics that Vivian had stolen from Pinehaven. Victor and Kate both spotted Vivian, but although she looked 'familiar', neither saw through the disguise.

  <Overview>Just as Carrie and Austin start a romantic evening, Sami calls because she scared and thinks someone is following her and it could be Alan, but as usual it's one of her plans. Austin to the rescue. Alan is up to something and buys a gun. Lex, Abe, Jonah and Wendy enjoy a family dinner. Carrie starts to put two and two together when it seems that whenever her and Austin have a special night planned, Sami always cries &quot;Help&quot;. She speaks to Jamie and tells her about Sami's latest call and that Alan maybe following her. Jamie says it couldn't be because she just saw Alan outside the Brady Pub. Later Austin returns Sami to the pub. When he goes back to Carrie, she tells him of her suspicions. He thinks it's a stupid idea.</Overview>

  <Overview>Bo and Hope finally made their way back to each other and were about to get married. A few weeks before the wedding Billie Reed returned. She started date Franco Kelly, but still was deeply in love with Bo. Bo was very suspicious about Franco and he believed that Franco was responsible for attacking a girl named Jill Stevens. Hope and Billie didn't actually believe that Franco was capable of doing something like that. But in fact, Franco made some very suspicious phone calls to his employer, a person that wants to break up Bo and Hope. Eventually the night before the wedding Billie was at the Horton Cabin. Bo just heard from Jill that her attacker was after someone else, so Bo believed that he would attack Billie. He went to the Horton Cabin and found Franco and a fight broke out. Franco did leave the island, but untied Bo's both. Bo couldn't get back to the church in time. His last attempt was trying to swim, but because it was so cold outside he didn't succeed and was frozen. Billie</Overview>

On Monday, Jennifer, John, and Marlena are about to leave the Blake house when Jenn sees a light on the second floor. They race upstairs, but don't discover Laura.
[Jennifer is certain she saw a light, and John feels someone was there too, so they decide to search the second floor again.] Instead of splitting up and verifying that every room is empty, they all go off together. Then they hear a noise coming from the first room, and rush back in. It's Celeste (who says she came in the back way), telling everyone that she had a psychic dream in which she saw Stefano and Peter with Laura. Jennifer fears the worst. [Marlena thinks it's horse-puckey. Strange coming from her, after her experience with Eugene's 'vibes'.] At Jennifer's request, Celeste describes her dream. Marlena shudders at the thought of Stefano being alive, and John reminds her that no body was found after the explosion in Aremid. It isn't unthinkable for Stefano to be alive. Celeste starts feeling</Overview>

  <Overview>Belle, Shawn, and Chloe have followed Mimi from the Last Blast dance, and overhear her talking to a drug dealer, telling him she will never sell drugs for him, no matter what. They continue to follow her, and are shocked when Mimi leads them to the tent that she, her mother Maureen, and her little brother Conner have been living in. Maureen wants to take a very sick Conner to a doctor, but Mimi says she can't risk anyone finding out what their living situation is. All of a sudden Belle announces that they already know, and they want to help. Mimi is shocked to see Belle and Shawn standing outside the tent, and horrified to find her nemesis Chloe with them.</Overview>

  <Overview>Mimi tells her friends to leave, she doesn't want them to see her like this. She takes off, and Belle goes to talk to her mother who tells them that everything was fine until her husband was laid off of work. They haven't heard from her father in days, and now little Conner is sick. Belle wants her to go to the free clinic, but Maureen said Mimi wants to keep what's going on a secret. Chloe understands how Mimi is feeling, and shows a rare burst of caring when she suggests they make helping the Lockharts their summer project.</Overview>

  <Overview>Belle, Shawn, Mimi, Maureen, and Conner show up at the hospital so someone can look at Conner. Initially the hospital balks since Mimi's family doesn't have insurance, but Belle assures them that John Black and Marlena Evans, who just so happen to be her parents, will take care of everything. While Conner and Maureen are in with the doctor, Shawn and Belle try to talk to Mimi about the conversation they witnessed between her and the drug dealer, but she angrily brushes them off. Her friends persis, and finally she breaks down and tells them everything. They promise not to tell. Mimi realises that Chloe also saw, but Belle assures Mimi that Chloe won't tell anyone; she says Chloe isn't that kind of person. Mimi goes to be with her mom and Conner, and Belle has a wonderful idea as to how they can help Mimi. She tells Shawn about Habitat for Humanity, and says she thinks they should help build Mimi a house. Shawn finally comes around, and then the two of them run into Alice, who agrees th</Overview>

  <Overview>Nancy isn't pleased to see the way Chloe and Craig are bonding, especially since Chloe treats her like garbage. When Craig complains to Nancy about the way Alice Horton treats the two of them and how she stands in his way at the hospital, Nancy tells him that if they were more civically minded, even 'that witch' Alice Horton couldn't complain. Nancy suggests that she and Craig offer to house Mimi and her family until they're able to find a home of their own, because it goes without saying that Mimi would never agree to the idea, but then they'll look that much better in the eyes of the community. Philip and Chloe have shown up and Philip is offering to help any way he can, but Shawn knows his old friend too well, and realises that Philip has an ulterior motive. Belle tells the teens that there are some complications...before Habitat for Humanity will help them, Mimi's father needs to get a job. Still with her mother and brother, Mimi continues to be upset that everyone found out, but M</Overview>

  <Overview>David Lockhart is reunited with his wife, son, and daughter, thanks to Shawn. He tells his family he is so sorry he wasn't there for him, but unfortunately, he *still* doesn't have a job. They decide to worry about that later and talk to Dawn from Habitat for Humanity, who tells them that at least one of them needs to work outside the home (David assures her he will take any job, anywhere, to support his family), assures the family that the home they build will be within their budget, but says they need some volunteers (of which they have plenty, most of them under the age of 18). Alice Horton opens her mouth to tell them that she will foot the bill for the hotel for as long as necessary when a press crew bursts in...followed by the Wesleys.</Overview>

  <Overview>Chloe acts like it's no big deal that there is a screaming banshee upstairs, and when she refuses to get involved, Nancy is suspicious that the glue in Mimi's shampoo isn't an accident. Mimi can't open the doors, so Nancy hits upon the idea of using a ladder to climb up to the bathroom window, but can't get in all the way. Unfortunately, Mimi can't get the window open because her hands are glued to her head. While Nancy tries desperately to get to a distraught Mimi, the ladder crashes to the ground, and Chloe laughs as two of the people she wants to hurt most in the world are stuck in an uncomfortable situation.
Up in her room, Marlena is packing her bags, torn between guilt at hurting her step-son, and a strong desire to be as far away from him as humanly possible.

  <Overview>Marlena looks at a family picture as she continues her plans to leave. John does his best to explain to Belle and Brady about Marlena leaving. After Marlena, John and Belle say their goodbyes, Brady follows Marlena to the hall, taunting her about his accident, and how it's her fault. Back in the penthouse, Brady receives a call from Maggie, who tells him he is no longer banned from Tuscany, and invites him to the party. At the Salem Inn, Maggie shows up to invite Marlena to the party as well. At Tuscany, Maggie pulls Hope aside, and gets her out of the way so that they are able to surprise her with a bridal shower. She sends Bo outside, and Roman and Abe grab him for a bachelor party. After the parties, the two groups join up together, bringing the kids into the mix. While Abby takes pictures, Bo and Hope talk about their beautiful baby boy. In the hallway, John watches the three of them, and is more determined than ever to be part of J.T.'s life.

  <Overview>Hope worries when she sees that John has shown up at the party, and she's not the only one. Abe and Lexie are also worried that John and Roman will let their differences ruin Bo and Hope's night. Hope is begging John to walk away from J.T. and let him be raised by her and Bo when Marlena shows up, and Marlena has the same question for him...can he walk away from his son? John's only response is to ask Marlena to come home with him, but she says she needs time on her own.
Shawn asks Belle to come to the party, but she won't leave Brady. While talking about the situation, Brady tells Belle that he doesn't blame Marlena and he wants her to come home. He's convinced that Roman is the one to blame, and that Roman shot him to impress Marlena. At Tuscany, John has the same idea, and orders Roman to leave, accusing him of being in love with Marlena.
At the party, Sami heads over to talk to Victor. She knows that he and Kate were behind her near death experiences in Italy, and she's not going t</Overview>

Spending the day with her son, Sami is both encouraged and worried to learn that Lucas is hitting the bottle pretty heavily again. She knows it will help her custody case, but she doesn't want her son exposed to that. Later, Nicole, Will, and Sami show up at the hospital Christmas party.
When Mimi shows up with her hair covered by a scarf, Jan, Shawn, and Jason are curious as to why, and want to know just what Mimi is hiding.

They quickly tell her that it is none of her business, but she manages to come back with a reply, &quot;&quot;Since I am going to marry Kate's son Austin, her marital stability is very much my business&quot;&quot;. Phillip is not pleased to see Sami taunting his parents, but stays quiet.  Sami then heads into the church with a &quot;&quot;Sami-style&quot;&quot; smirk on her face.

Lucas shows up, demanding that Sami sign the custody papers for Will. Brandon intervenes, but Sami signs the papers out of fear that Lucas will reveal the tape from Vegas.

Colin brings Tony a vial of truth serum to give to Marlena; John sits in an exterminator van, which is filled with high tech equipment to allow him to monitor Marlena's conversation with Tony through her bugged earring. Colin slips out and Marlena arrives; Tony drops the serum in some water and tries to get Marlena drink it, but he's unsuccessful. Marlena starts to snoop when Tony leaves the room and she finds the pictures of the island, which triggers the sound of waves to echo in her head, driving her into a fugue state of her own. While out of it, she knocks her earring transmitter off and it falls into her glass of water, rendering it inoperable. Tony returns and Marlena says in her trance-like state that Stefano's making her sleep so that she can save the future of the DiMeras. She snaps out of it, but Tony doesn't reveal what she's said. John barges in because he lost his connection with Marlena, and they are both forced to cover his sudden appearance. They</Overview>

SUMMARY:   The summary is written a little different today.  Since 95% of the episode took place at the Kirikas mansion, I thought the best way to write it up was in the exact order it took placeâ€¦
Part One:   The guests gather and wait for the start of the wedding.  Chloe and Brady slip away to the front hall as Bo and Jennifer exit to get something to drink.  Chloe comments on how tense everything is. Brady tells her he wishes it were over already so they could be aloneâ€¦  Sami walks in the dining room and pulls out the gun and says, &quot;&quot;if there was any other wayâ€¦&quot;&quot;  Just then, Belle walks in and wants to know what she's doingâ€¦  Upstairs, Nicole is still reading the letter from Collin and he tells her the 5 million dollars was only a down payment and how she should save her pennies.  He lied to her about there being no copies</Overview>

SUMMARY   At the DiMera compound, Tony has the tower room set up like it was when Marlena was held there. Marlena looks all around and says that something very important happened here. John is obviously uncomfortable with this idea, but Tony refuses to let him disrupt what is going to happen. Marlena tells them that she will do whatever it takes to remember what happened to her. Marlena gets up on the bed and lays down (almost looks like a hospital bed) and before long, she begins to have memory flashes. She remembers being in that very bed the night of a terrible storm and seeing a doctor at the end of her bed as she is in a fetal position, giving birth to the twins! Dr. Rolf was the doctor who was there and encouraged her to deliver them (although at this point, Marlena makes no reference that she knows who the DR is). As she is telling John and Tony about this, Tony grabs Marlena's h</Overview>

  <Overview>PREVIEW: Things heat up between Shawn and Maya; Cassie unveils big news to John.
SUMMARY:
At the Kirikas mansion, Nicole is trying desperately to come up with a cover story for Brady about why she was in his shower and she ends up telling him that she got covered in mud when she was out in the stables earlier. She can tell that Brady is hesitant to buy that story, so she drops her towel, hoping that he will look at her all naked and that would distract him. To her surprise, Brady gently tells her that she should not be using her body when she has so much more to offer. She scrambles around and eventually takes off out of Brady's bathroom so he can enjoy a peaceful shower. She hurries out to the stables to see Larry, who is angry with her for leaving him there with no food and he tells her he will take off and not do her dirty work. He makes it known that there is one thing she can do that just might change his mind. Nicole remembers back to what Brady said to her upstairs and she puts</Overview>

SUMMARY:
At Salem Place, Roman tells Kate that he has something special to ask her later. She smiles and asks what he has to ask her, but he tells her he can't say it right now.

She smiles and just says that ceremonies make her upset.
Later Sami breaks into the guards box and steals the guard's gun. She then mentions that Abe has crossed the line!

As she walks into the door, she is confronted by Roman's spirit, who begs her not to do this. Although Marlena can't forget all the good times, she also remembers her victims as well, and says she is doing all this for her family.

  <Overview>Bo and Hope are shocked to find Alice barely alive, and desperately trying to tell them what happened. Hope begs her grandmother to hang on as Bo calls for help. Tek and Lexie finally show up, and Lexie has the heartbreaking job of telling Bo and Hope, and the recently arrived Shawn and Belle, that Alice is gone. Despite Shawn's grief, he does his best to comfort Belle, as Hope tells Bo that if Marlena is guilty, it means that Belle lied about her alibi ... and that Belle may be responsible for Alice's death. At the penthouse, John confronts Marlena, who caves and runs into his arms, only to pull back with his gun in her hands and telling him that she will kill him. She tries to force him off the balcony, and as the two struggle, Marlena trips and falls over the side, much to a watching Sami's horror. Nicole is terrified that Marlena has figured out that she and Jan were behind Victor's death, but all Jan can think about is getting Shawn.</Overview>

  <Overview>Marlena regains consciousness on the roof, but Bo has given a 'shoot first, ask questions later' order. Kate pushes Philip to take advantage of Belle while Shawn is gone but he refuses; he reminds her that he pined after Chloe while she was in love with Brady, and he won't pine after Belle while she loves Shawn. While Julie accuses Bonnie and Patrick of all manner of crimes, Patrick sneaks out to the Cheatin' Heart after getting a call from Shawn, and gets Jennifer's bearer bonds back from his mystery associate.</Overview>

  <Overview>Mickey gives Bonnie a brooch he had initially given Maggie when they had opened Tuscany, and even Bonnie is surprised at herself when she finds she just doesn't feel worth of gift, which Mimi later congrulates her mother for. Bo and Hope continue to be concerned that they have yet to hear from Shawn, and Bo finally tells Hope that he'll put in an unofficial request to have the other officers keep an eye out for him. Nicole keeps an eye on Shawn while Jan is preparing to bail Crystal out of jail, but visions of a shirtless Brady almost have her releasing him from his bonds until she has second thoughts. A griefstricken Sami feels like she has lost everyone who loves her, but Lucas assures her that he will still be there for her no matter what.</Overview>

On the island, Marlena is in shock as Alice explains that they're not dead, but it takes Roman's appearance and his assurance that they are indeed alive and well for her to believe it. At the Kiriakis Mansion, Nicole is shocked to find Crystal standing at her door, and does some fancy footwork to convince Brady that her adult film star friend was a rehab patient of Marlena's.

  <Overview>Marlena is thrilled to see Maggie on the fantasy island, and the two talk about how much they miss their loved ones. Maggie is uninterested when Marlena talks about Bonnie. Julie and Bonnie get their lines crossed, and Bonnie orders a very spicy order of Chinese from Julie, who is disgusted that Bonnie is already considering herself the next Mrs. Horton. Kate and Lucas watch Sami with Ray, not realising that she's trying to find a way to bring Kate down, and Lucas issues her an ultimatum. John tells Brady about Crystal and Nicole being in jail at the same time, but Brady defends Nicole to his father.</Overview>

  <Overview>Bo continues to search for Billie, but when he finally locates her, she's in pretty bad shape. She begs Bo to warn the others, but before Bo can move, both he and Billie are shot with darts. Hope goes to Tony to ask him to help her bypass the forcefield so she can go after Bo. He declines to help her, and tries to convince her that her family would be traumatized if anything happened to her. Hope manages to get her hands on his remote and takes off, and Tony tells Bart that anyone in the jungle is fair game. Shawn awakens, and Lexie asks whether he'd prefer to see Belle or Jan. With flashbacks of Belle and Philip in his head he asks for Jan, who shocks Philip and Belle by announcing their engagement.</Overview>

  <Overview>Hope ruins the afterglow of making love with Bo on the boat by bringing up all the good times Bo and Billie had together on the Fancy Face. She suggests Patrick as a good man for Billie, but Bo is adamant that Patrick isn't right for her. Stan/Sami offers to help Jan in her plotting, but Jan initially doesn't want any help until Stan/Sami reveals that he knows all about Mimi's abortion and Shawn's kidnapping. Thanks to the spiked drinks, Billie is less inhibited as she dances with Patrick, and Abby warns Chelsea that if they get together, it's all her fault.</Overview>

  <Overview>While examining Jan, Lexie realises she has a skull fracture and will probably have some brain damage. Tek is the officer in charge of the investigation, and Lexie suggests that Mimi might know what Jan was up to. At the Church, Nicole realises there is something not quite kosher but Nancy soon interrupts, asking Nicole to leave, and urges Brady to say goodbye to Chloe.
