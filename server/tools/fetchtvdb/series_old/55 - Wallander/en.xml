  <Overview>The dead couple Olof and Carolina Wachman are found murdered in their magnificent estate. The investigation finds that she has been tortured and raped in front of her husband before they were both killed. A death that must have been a relief after the torture they both went through.
Kurt Wallanders daughter Linda and DI Stefan Lindman now have to show that they are as good a pair of investigators as Kurt Wallander himself.
Slowly but surely we see that the murder is about revenge, a revenge that can be traced back 20 years.

  <Overview>An explosion in one of Ystad's power grids shuts down the electricity in the whole city. Wallander (Krister Henriksson), who is in the middle of a crayfish party at his newly bought house with his colleagues, are called in in the middle of the night. At the same time, the municipal commissioner of Ystad, who has just approved and inaugurated an exhibition showing pictures of Muhammed, the muslim prophet, at the city hall, is being murdered in his house. With less policemen than usual due to various reasons, Wallander and his men are having a hard time taking care of both cases. It gets even worse when several cars placed on various roads outside Ystad explodes, the security service (SäPo) are asking questions, and the police commisioner calles in the army to keep Ystad safe. As to make things even more complicated for Wallander's crew, the minister of defence announces that she will come to Ystad to show her support. However, more people is being murdered as the movie plays along; an old woman working at the jobcentre and a nurse at the city hospital. Leads that in the beginning seemed to point to muslim fundamentalists are now pointing more and more against one of the army majors, who has been going on a killing spree as a revenge for the death of his son some years erlier, and the closure of Ystad's regiment where he was working (Hämnden means The Revenge). When the Wallander-crew are starting to put two and two together, it may already be too late. The minister of defence has arrived to Ystad and is going to hold a speech at the city square, guarded by both the police, SäPo, and the army (the suspected major is standing on the stage when the minister is having her speech. When the speech ends, they raise their hands together in victory, and the major handcuffs the minister to his wrist, and reveals that he has a bomb planted on his chest. Wallander negotiates with the major, who agrees to let the minister go, and let Wallander take her place. The major and Wallander drives to the harbor where after some dialog Wallander is released and steps out of the car. The car that the major is sitting in is then hit from behind by another car, driven by the policeman who was on guard at the municipal commisioner the night he was killed, and pushed into the water, where the bomb goes off. The reason the major took the very drastic action with a bomb is explained by his medical condition; he had cancer, and wanted to get his revenge before he died. (From IMDB)</Overview>

  <Overview>Kurt becomes emotionally involved in the case of Amanda, a young girl who comes to the police station to report her mother Julia missing.  

When Julia's badly burned body is found on the beach near the family villa, Kurt suspect's Amanda's father Erik - the broken family as his motive. But Erik seems to be protecting someone: there's a surveillance film on Julia's computer, and he knows things he doesn't seem keen to disclose. Martinsson is becoming worried about Kurt increasing memory problems - he forgets people's names and where he leaves things. Is he really suitable for such a serious investigation? Linda is not worried, but is she turning a blind eye to the obvious?</Overview>

  <Overview>Kurt sees a doctor for his memory problems. At the same time, a young woman's body is found at an excavation site in Ystad. It turns out to be the remains of a prostitute from Moldova.

The investigation leads to a Russian trafficker who calls himself a fashion photographer who seems to have been cruelly exploting young women. Wallander wants to know more about the girl, so goes to Moldava where he meets her desperate father and twin sister. They tell a different story about Tatiana: that she was happy and sent home large sums of money.

Back in Sweden, Kurt has a car accident, leading Mattson to sign him off sick so he'll stay out of the investigation. But Kurt continues to secretly investigate the case, and to face the question of whether it is always right to tell the truth. Meanwhile, Kurt receives a reply from the doctor about his memory problems.  He opens the envelope and stares silently at the doctor's words.  </Overview>

  <Overview>It's almost Christmas and Kurt's memory disease is becoming more serious. He realizes that it will soon be necessary to tell his colleagues and the rest of the world that he's sick, but finds the idea of giving up his job - his only identity - hard to face.  

In Ystad, there is a brutal kidnapping of a famous restaurateur, Paolo Salino. Kurt takes on the case, but is forced to enlist the help of his colleague Jenny at Malmö police. But she does not live up to all that she pretends to be, and is slow in understanding what Kurt is looking for. When the tracks of the investigation lead straight into the police ranks, the resolution - Kurt's final event as a policeman - turns violent. One final battle that is about Kurt's struggle against his illness and towards justice in a corrupt police force. He is forced to ask himself one last time, why he chose to be a cop.</Overview>
