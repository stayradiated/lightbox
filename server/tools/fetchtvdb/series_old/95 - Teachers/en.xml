  <Overview>Teachers was a highly successful Channel 4 comedy about a group of immature teachers working in Summerdown School, in Bristol.  Their expert subjects included ineptness with the opposite sex, beer drinking, and kebab eating.

Teachers began in 2001 and in 2003 became the only Channel 4 series to have a third series. In 2004 it broke its own record with a fourth series airing.  Unfortunately, in January 2005 Channel 4 producers announced that Teachers had run its course and would not be returning for a fifth series.

Teachers main characters were: Simon: The English teacher with girlfriend problems and poor teaching skills; Susan: The Maths teacher - everyone's friend and always on hand for some sound advice.  Jenny: The authoritarian English teacher who disapproves of Simon and has a sharp tongue; Brian and Kurt: The two inseperable PE and Computers teachers who provided the show's comic relief through insane stunts and behavior.</Overview>

On his last day he is surprised with a party and a nice send off from his friends.</Overview>

  <Overview>As Christmas draws near, the teachers, minus an absent Simon attend the staff annual party. After Jenny tells Bob's wife that he is very popular with the female staff, he gets lucky, over and over again.   It appears that there is much Christmas spirit, as Liz tries sex with Kurt and is then disappointed with his small genitalia. Susan takes advice from Jenny and sleeps with Brian, who it turns out, is better than Kurt. Penny quickly jumps into bed with Simon's replacement English teacher Matt, but is upset when she discovers that he is married with children. As they finish the term in the pub, Carol walks in after finishing with Errol and Kurt is delighted. The subject of their non-existant sex comes up and when asked why they haven't yet done it, Kurt replies &quot;&quot;We are saving ourselves&quot;&quot;, to which everyone bursts out laughing.</Overview>
