  <Overview>It was sixteen minute’s past five (Earth Time) on Saturday the 23rd November 1963, the day after the assassination of President Kennedy, when Doctor Who first materialised on to BBC Television. Squeezed in between the football results and the Telegoons, a legend was born. So, from humble flickering beginnings more than 30 years ago, began the eccentric Timelord’s crusade against evil. Now this fascinating documentary charts that remarkable career in time travel.</Overview>

  <Overview>What do you get if you cross a Krynoid with an Auton, Sontaran and a sombrero wearing Cyberon with a penchant for fine wines and Ex-cell-ent conversation?
Shot probably.
On the other hand you could have landed yourself in the middle of the Licensed Reality Corporations' ™ attempt to wipe the stain of the Foot Doctor from the bottom of Accepted Canonicity.
Packed full of strange whizzy things, blue swirly things, and more than its fair share of spoons, &quot;Do You Have A Licence To Save This Planet?&quot; brings Sylvester McCoy into battle against some of the most fearsome (as seen on BBCTV's Doctor Who) monsters of all time.
Armed only with a duffle coat, an umbrella and a patented Sylvester-o-matic-talk-them-to-death-o-tron the Foot Doctor has come to save the universe once again.
He's back. And it's about feet.

  <Overview>The Final Curtain - Five years after its re-invention in colour and its rise to massive popularity, it was time for Doctor Who’s charismatic lead actor Jon Pertwee to move on… and with him the production team that had guided the show throughout that period. This documentary looks at the background to the Third Doctor’s swansong.
John Kane Remembers - John Kane memorably played the gentle, slow-witted Tommy, reborn through the power of the Metebelis crystal. An accomplished writer and series creator, Kane now lives in France, from where he looks back on his memories of the story.
Directing Who: Barry Letts - Barry Letts is perhaps most famous as producer of Doctor Who, but he was also responsible for directing some of the show’s best-loved stories. Barry looks back on his career as a director in this documentary.
Now and Then - The latest instalment in our ongoing series takes a trip back to some of the locations used during production of the story.
‘Planet of the Spiders’ omnibus edition - The full-length omnibus edit of the story, presented here totally unrestored.</Overview>

  <Overview>This special one-off drama travels back in time to 1963 to see how Doctor Who was first brought to the screen.
Actor William Hartnell felt trapped by a succession of hard-man roles. Wannabe producer Verity Lambert was frustrated by the TV industry's glass ceiling. Both of them were to find unlikely hope and unexpected challenges in the form of a Saturday tea-time drama. Allied with a team of unusual but brilliant people, they went on to create the longest running science fiction series ever made.</Overview>

  <Overview> “Even Time Lords die...”

When a dissident Time Lord group inadvertently caused the destruction of an entire civilisation through interference, its members vowed to repent by serving the Universe not as gods of Time but as mere men. Many years later, this peaceful resolve is severely tested when two of their number are killed -- and the Doctor’s seventh incarnation becomes embroiled in the struggle against the apparently unstoppable General Tannis.

Plagued by ominous portents, the Doctor and his companion Antimony must race across the Universe, taking in the Santine Republic, the Great Orion Nebula and the frozen heart of the Canisian Empire. Meanwhile, the mysterious Minister of Chance battles his own inner demons, and former TARDIS traveller Ace finds herself in training for a destiny she never dreamed possible. Matters reach a terrible climax when Tannis’ next target for subjugation is identified. Exactly how much is the Doctor prepared to sacrifice in order to save Earth?</Overview>

  <Overview>London, 1963. Schoolteachers Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright are perplexed by the behaviour of one of their pupils, Susan Foreman. Her knowledge of science and history exceeds theirs, yet she seems totally ignorant of many common aspects of everyday life. They follow her to her home address, a junkyard with a police telephone box standing in it, and encounter her grandfather, the enigmatic Doctor. When they force their way past him into the police box, Susan's secret is revealed: she and the Doctor are aliens, and the police box is a time machine, the TARDIS, capable of visiting any point in the universe at any moment in time…</Overview>

The travellers are forced to accompany Polo on his long trek across Asia to the Khan's court, but their many attempts to reclaim their property are foiled -- not just by Polo, but by the war lord Tegana, who is apparently on a mission of peace but has entirely different plans for dealing with Kublai Khan...</Overview>

  <Overview>The Doctor\'s friends are captured by soldiers in post-Revolutionary France, during the reign of terror in which anyone suspected of Royalist sympathies is immediately executed. Ian is thrown into jail with a dying English prisoner, who gives him a vital message for English master spy James Stirling. Robespierre\'s right-hand man, Citizen Lemaitre, secretly helps Ian to escape. The Doctor arrives, disguised as a prominent Citizen to arrange for his friends\' release, but Lemaitre sees through his guise and threatens to have Susan executed unless the Doctor leads him to the escape route run by Jules Renan. There, Lemaitre reveals himself to be Stirling, and enlists Ian and Barbara\'s help to complete his mission. So doing, they see Paul Barrass inviting Napoleon Bonaparte to rule the country as part of a triumverate after Robespierre is overthrown. Stirling tries to stop this for the sake of his own country, but he is too late to prevent the mob from turning on Robespierre. Nevertheless he is true to his word and releases Susan, allowing the travellers to escape from Paris.</Overview>

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises in London in mid-22nd century. Dalek invaders are now ruling the Earth with the aid of humans converted into zombie-like &quot;Robomen&quot;, but they are opposed by a group of resistance fighters. The Doctor and his companions discover that the Daleks have created a large mine in the English countryside for the purpose of removing the Earth's core (using a massive explosive device) and replacing it with a powerful drive system so that they can pilot the planet around the galaxy. Ian manages to create a barrier in the shaft in order to intercept and deflect the bomb. The resulting explosion destroys the Daleks and their mine. The Earth is safe once again! However, Susan has fallen in love with resistance fighter David Campbell, and the Doctor decides to leave her on Earth to find a new life with him. The Doctor continues on his travels with Ian and Barbara.</Overview>

  <Overview>Sometime in the 25th century, the Doctor and his friends land on the planet Dido and happen across a spaceship (from Earth) that has crash-landed. Its two occupants - a man named Bennett and a young girl called Vicki - are living in fear of a creature called Koquillion, a native of Dido possibly responsible for murdering other members from the spaceship. However, the Doctor realises after a while that Koquillion is in fact Bennett in disguise; it was Bennett who killed the others so as to conceal an earlier murder that he had performed on ship. In a confrontation with Dido humanoid inhabitants Bennett dies as he falls from a cliff. Not wishing the girl Vicki to be alone, the Doctor takes her with him in the TARDIS as a new companion.

  <Overview>The story begins with the Doctor and his three friends, including new girl Vicki,in the year 64 AD enjoying a holiday at an Italian villa But the Doctor gets bored and sets off to visit nearby Rome, taking Vicki with him. While they are away, Ian and Barbara are captured by slave traders. In Rome the Doctor is mistaken for a musician and is asked to perform at Emperor Nero's Court. The Doctor, however, can't play a note and has to come up with elaborate schemes to avoid revealing this!!. Ian becomes a galley slave, while Barbara is sold to Nero's slave buyer Tavius at an auction in Rome. Ian and another slave escape from the galley when it is wrecked in a storm. They make their way to Rome to try to find and rescue Barbara but are recaptured and forced to fight as gladiators in the Arena. Events climax when, by accidentally setting fire to Nero's plans for the rebuilding of Rome, the Doctor gives him the idea of having the city burned to the ground. Nero plays the lyre while Rome burns, and the Doctor, Vicki and a now reunited Ian and Barbara go back to the villa.

  <Overview>The story begins with the Doctor and his three friends, including new girl Vicki,in the year 64 AD enjoying a holiday at an Italian villa But the Doctor gets bored and sets off to visit nearby Rome, taking Vicki with him. While they are away, Ian and Barbara are captured by slave traders. In Rome the Doctor is mistaken for a musician and is asked to perform at Emperor Nero's Court. The Doctor, however, can't play a note and has to come up with elaborate schemes to avoid revealing this!!. Ian becomes a galley slave, while Barbara is sold to Nero's slave buyer Tavius at an auction in Rome. Ian and another slave escape from the galley when it is wrecked in a storm. They make their way to Rome to try to find and rescue Barbara but are recaptured and forced to fight as gladiators in the Arena. Events climax when, by accidentally setting fire to Nero's plans for the rebuilding of Rome, the Doctor gives him the idea of having the city burned to the ground. Nero plays the lyre while Rome burns, and the Doctor, Vicki and a now reunited Ian and Barbara go back to the villa.

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises in the Holy Land during King Richard I's crusade against the Muslims. Saracen raiders led by the evil El Akir attack the King's hunting party, and when the travellers stumble into the fray the King escapes and Barbara is captured. The King, weary of the fighting, knights Ian and sends him to the Sultan Saladin's court, to negotiate Barbara's release and offer the hand of the King's sister in marriage to the Sultan's brother, Saphadin. However, Ian learns that El Akir, humiliated by his failure to capture Richard, has taken Barbara to add to his harem. With the help of a mischievous bandit and a merchant whose family was murdered by El Akir, Ian rescues Barbara and takes her back to Jaffa. There, despite their best efforts to avoid palace politics, the Doctor and Vicki have made an enemy of the Earl of Leicester, and the travellers barely escape with their lives.

They help the native people of Xeros to revolt against the Moroks. The revolution succeeds, the future is changed, and the travellers depart in the TARDIS.

  <Overview>The Doctor and his companions learn that a group of Daleks, equipped with a time machine of their own, are on their trail with orders to exterminate them. The Doctor et al flee in the TARDIS and a chase begins! First stop is the planet Aridius and they then go onto various other places including New York's Empire State Building, the ship Mary Celeste and a haunted house! Eventually both time machines arrive on the planet Mechanus, where the Daleks try to kill the Doctor's group using a robot double of him. The travellers are taken prisoner by the Mechanoids - a group of colonizing robots - and meet Steven Taylor, a stranded astronaut who has been the Mechanoids' captive for the past two years. The Daleks and the Mechanoids do battle, leading to their mutual destruction, whilst the Doctor and his companions escape with Ian and Barbara returning home to Earth in the Dalek's time machine!

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises on a doomed planet in Galaxy 4, and the travellers are captured by warriors of the beautiful female clone race known as Drahvins. According to the Drahvins' leader, Maaga, their ship was shot down in an unprovoked attack by the vicious alien Rills, but they managed to inflict damage on the Rill ship as well; now both ships are stuck here, on a planet doomed to explode in fourteen days. Maaga orders the Doctor to help her and her warriors capture the Rill ship, and keeps Steven hostage to ensure his co-operation; however, the Doctor soon learns that Maaga is both lying and mistaken. The Drahvins are in fact the aggressors, and the peaceful Rills want nothing more than to escape in one piece – and help their enemies do so as well, if they can. Unfortunately, that may not be possible, as the Doctor discovers that time is shorter than they thought; the planet in fact has less than a day of life remaining...

According to the Drahvins' leader, Maaga, their ship was shot down in an unprovoked attack by the vicious alien Rills, but they managed to inflict damage on the Rill ship as well; now both ships are stuck here, on a planet doomed to explode in fourteen days. Maaga orders the Doctor to help her and her warriors capture the Rill ship, and keeps Steven hostage to ensure his co-operation; however, the Doctor soon learns that Maaga is both lying and mistaken. The Drahvins are in fact the aggressors, and the peaceful Rills want nothing more than to escape in one piece – and help their enemies do so as well, if they can. Unfortunately, that may not be possible, as the Doctor discovers that time is shorter than they thought; the planet in fact has less than a day of life remaining...

  <Overview>Space Security agent Marc Cory visits the planet Kembel to investigate rumours of Dalek activity in the area. However, his ship is shot down and his crewmates are poisoned by the thorns of Varga plants, genetically engineered carnivores which transform their unlucky victims into Vargas as well. Despite these dangers, Cory discovers that the Daleks have formed an alliance with several other alien species, intending to launch a war against Earth. He makes a tape of his discoveries -- but is exterminated before he can get word to his superiors...

  <Overview>The TARDIS arrives on the plains of Asia Minor during the Trojan War, and when the Doctor emerges the credulous Achilles mistakes him for Zeus. The brutal Odysseus finds this highly unlikely, especially when he catches Steven trying to rescue his friend. When the TARDIS disappears, and the Doctor is thus unable to present a miracle to the Greeks, he is sentenced to death – but Odysseus, intrigued by the newcomers, offers to spare the Doctor's life if he comes up with a way to end the war. The TARDIS has in fact been captured by the Trojans and taken into the city, where Vicki befriends the royal family, adopts the name Cressida – and makes a bitter enemy of the high priestess Cassandra, who feels she has a monopoly on foretelling the future. Outside the city, the Doctor eventually has little choice but to suggest the construction of a large wooden horse, and history takes its unfortunate course. Vicki, who has fallen in love with the Trojan prince Troilus, rescues him from the massacre, and together they join cavalry leader Aeneas and set off to found another city – Rome. Having lost one companion, the Doctor and Steven depart from Troy with a temple handmaiden named Katarina.

  <Overview>The Daleks assemble the leaders of several alien empires, apparently intending to unite them in an Alliance which will then declare war on Earth. In fact, each empire has brought components or technology which the Daleks require to construct the ultimate weapon – a Time Destructor. The last component they require is the power source, a core of the rare element Taranium – and Mavic Chen, the Guardian of the Solar System, intends to supply it to them and then betray them, seizing the Time Destructor for himself. The Doctor and his companions stumble into this affair when the TARDIS materialises on Kembel, and with the aid of Space Security Service agent Bret Vyon, sent to investigate the disappearance of Marc Cory, the Doctor steals the taranium core. The Daleks pursue the Doctor and his companions across the galaxy to get it back, and in the course of the flight the Trojan handmaiden Katarina gives her life to help the Doctor escape from a vicious criminal.

  <Overview>When the Doctor and his friends arrive on Earth, they find that Chen has already denounced them as traitors, and Vyon is shot and killed by his own sister, Sara Kingdom. Sara eventually discovers the truth for herself, and helps the Doctor and Steven to recover the TARDIS and escape. However, the Daleks then pursue them through Time, and are joined by the Doctor and Steven's old enemy, the Meddling Monk – who realises that he's in over his head and switches sides depending upon who seems to be on top. After an encounter in ancient Egypt, the Doctor strands the Monk on an ice planet, but the Daleks get away with the taranium core, and the Doctor uses the navigational unit from the Monk's TARDIS to pursue them back to Kembel. There, the Daleks exterminate Mavic Chen, but the Doctor manages to activate the Time Destructor.

  <Overview>When the Doctor and his friends arrive on Earth, they find that Chen has already denounced them as traitors, and Vyon is shot and killed by his own sister, Sara Kingdom. Sara eventually discovers the truth for herself, and helps the Doctor and Steven to recover the TARDIS and escape. However, the Daleks then pursue them through Time, and are joined by the Doctor and Steven's old enemy, the Meddling Monk – who realises that he's in over his head and switches sides depending upon who seems to be on top. After an encounter in ancient Egypt, the Doctor strands the Monk on an ice planet, but the Daleks get away with the taranium core, and the Doctor uses the navigational unit from the Monk's TARDIS to pursue them back to Kembel. There, the Daleks exterminate Mavic Chen, but the Doctor manages to activate the Time Destructor. Sara ages to death before she can reach the safety of the TARDIS, but the Doctor and Steven escape while the Dalek force on Kembel crumbles to dust.

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises in Paris in the year 1572, and the Doctor leaves Steven on his own while he visits the apothecary Charles Preslin. However, Preslin faces persecution at the hands of the Catholics, and the Doctor thus comes up with a scheme to get him out of Paris. Steven, meanwhile, falls in with a group of Huguenots who fear that the Catholics are plotting against them, but when Steven recognises the Abbot of Amboise as the Doctor, his Huguenot friends conclude that he's part of the conspiracy. As it happens, the Abbot in fact only looks like the Doctor, but since the Huguenots won't listen to Steven's warnings, the Admiral de Coligny is mortally wounded in an assassination attempt orchestrated by the Queen Mother, Catherine de Medici. When the attempt fails, the Queen Mother manages to convince her weak-willed son that the Huguenots will respond violently, and he authorises the slaughter of all Huguenots within the city. The real Doctor returns, and he and Steven escape just as the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre begins. The TARDIS then materialises briefly in present-day Wimbledon, where a young girl named Dodo Chaplet stumbles aboard the TARDIS and is whisked away on new adventures.

  <Overview>The TARDIS arrives some 10,000,000 years in the future on a giant spaceship. The ship is carrying all of the Earth's surviving plant, animal and human life (and is hence nicknamed The Ark) on a 700 year-long trip to a new home on the planet Refusis. The Doctors' companion Dodo has a head cold but the human Guardians of the ship, and their servant race the Monoids, have no resistance, and so a plague breaks out!! The Guardians place the travellers on trial and Steven has to defend them against the charge that they deliberately spread the disease. However, the Doctor finds a cure. The TARDIS leaves the spaceship only to arrive back there as it is approaching the end of its voyage. As a result of the earlier plague, the Monoids have now grown strong and enslaved the humans. They plan to make Refusis their own but the Doctor persuades the two races to live together in peace.

  <Overview>The Doctor, Steven and Dodo fall into the clutches of the Celestial Toymaker, an immortal who challenges his victims to games – with their souls forfeit to him should they lose. While the Doctor plays the Trilogic Game, a variation on the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle, Steven and Dodo are sent on a quest to find the TARDIS, against opponents who may be figments of the Toymaker's imagination – or may be living beings, ensnared in his clutches, who seek to escape. If they win their games, the Toyroom will be destroyed, and the Toymaker will go on to construct another… but this means that the Doctor must find a way to make the last move of his game without destroying himself and his friends along with the Toyroom.

  <Overview>Suffering from toothache, the Doctor puts down in Tombstone, Arizona, where the local dentist is none other than the notorious Doc Holliday. The Clanton brothers have ridden into town, looking for the man who killed their brother – and when they see the Doctor in Doc Holliday's office, and he answers to the name &quot;Doc,&quot; they think they've found him. Marshall Wyatt Earp plays along with the mistake in order to give his old friend Holliday enough time to get out of town – but events get out of control when the Clantons threaten to lynch Steven in order to lure the Doctor out of hiding. Wyatt is forced to arrest Phineas Clanton, and when the others break their brother out of jail they shoot and kill Wyatt's own brother Virgil. The grief-stricken Wyatt thus calls them out, and the Doctor finds himself unable to prevent the infamous gunfight at the OK Corral.

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises in what the Doctor claims is a time of great peace and prosperity – but if the Elders of the city are so wise and powerful why do savages still live in the wilderness outside the city walls? And why do the people of the city apparently hunt and harvest the savages? The Doctor learns that all of the Elders' great achievements are based on a terrible form of exploitation; the people of the city are harvesting the life essence of the savages, reducing them to little more than cattle and devastating their civilisation while the Elders prosper. When the Doctor vows to put an end to this, the leader of the Elders, Jano, has him sent to the laboratories – but Jano, unwilling to risk the life essence of an alien on any of his people, takes it all into himself, and thus acquires the Doctor's morals and ethics as well. With Jano's help, the Doctor, Steven and Dodo organise the savages and help them strike back against the cruel Elders. They will require a strong leader to guide them, however, and they choose Steven, who leaves the Doctor's company to lead the newly united people.

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises in what the Doctor claims is a time of great peace and prosperity – but if the Elders of the city are so wise and powerful why do savages still live in the wilderness outside the city walls? And why do the people of the city apparently hunt and harvest the savages? The Doctor learns that all of the Elders' great achievements are based on a terrible form of exploitation; the people of the city are harvesting the life essence of the savages, reducing them to little more than cattle and devastating their civilisation while the Elders prosper. When the Doctor vows to put an end to this, the leader of the Elders, Jano, has him sent to the laboratories – but Jano, unwilling to risk the life essence of an alien on any of his people, takes it all into himself, and thus acquires the Doctor's morals and ethics as well. With Jano's help, the Doctor, Steven and Dodo organise the savages and help them strike back against the cruel Elders. They will require a strong leader to guide them, however, and they choose Steven, who leaves the Doctor's company to lead the newly united people.

  <Overview>London 1966 and the Doctor and Dodo, on a visit to the Post Office Tower, meet Professor Brett whose new computer WOTAN can actually think for itself and is soon to be networked with other computers around the world. However, WOTAN believes that humans are inferior to machines and should, therefore, be ruled by them. Exerting a hypnotic influence, WOTAN arranges for the construction of War Machines - heavily-armed, self-contained mobile computers - with which to take over the world. These prove more than a match for the Army, but the Doctor is able to capture one of them, which he then re-programs to destroy WOTAN. When the crisis is over, Dodo chooses to remain in London; Ben and Polly, however, inadvertently become the Doctor's new companions when they enter the TARDIS to return his lost key.

  <Overview>Ben and Polly's first trip by TARDIS takes them to the 17th-century Cornish coast, in the era of smugglers and pirates. There, the Doctor receives a clue to the location of hidden pirate treasure – making him a target for the vicious captain Pike. His interrogation is delayed when a smuggler named Jacob Kewper contacts Pike, erroneously believing him to be a fellow smuggler; when Pike learns that the local Squire is the head of a smuggling ring, he decides to impersonate a smuggler, learn the location of the smugglers' hoard, and then kill them all and acquire the goods for himself. The Doctor and Kewper manage to escape, but Kewper goes straight to the Squire with news of the hidden treasure. The Doctor and his friends have only one ally – Revenue man Josiah Blake, who has been investigating smuggling in the area but now finds that all hell is about to break loose. While Blake rides for the militia, the Doctor struggles to decipher the clue he's been given, knowing that only by locating the treasure himself can he bargain with the pirates and smugglers and prevent a battle which will inevitably result in the deaths of innocent townsfolk.

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises decades in the future, in the year 1986, at Snowcap Tracking Station at the South Pole. There, an international team is struggling to bring down a shuttle which has inexplicably been drawn out of orbit – by the gravity of a tenth planet, Earth's exact mirror twin. The Doctor realises what's about to happen, but before he can deliver his warning, Snowcap is invaded by the Cybermen – natives of the planet Mondas who have slowly replaced most of their body parts with cybernetic prostheses, and who have now returned to their twin to drain the energy away from Earth. However, the Doctor and his friends soon find themselves fighting a threat closer to home – in order to save his astronaut son, the American General Cutler intends to attack Mondas with a Z-Bomb despite the danger that the radiation from the explosion will render half of Earth uninhabitable. The Doctor realises that the Cybermen have invaded Earth because Mondas is drawing away too much energy, and that their best hope is simply to stall the Cybermen until Mondas explodes of its own accord. But the energy drain is affecting the elderly Doctor's health, and when he finally returns to his TARDIS he collapses – and before Ben's and Polly's eyes, he seems to change into an entirely different person...

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises decades in the future, in the year 1986, at Snowcap Tracking Station at the South Pole. There, an international team is struggling to bring down a shuttle which has inexplicably been drawn out of orbit – by the gravity of a tenth planet, Earth's exact mirror twin. The Doctor realises what's about to happen, but before he can deliver his warning, Snowcap is invaded by the Cybermen – natives of the planet Mondas who have slowly replaced most of their body parts with cybernetic prostheses, and who have now returned to their twin to drain the energy away from Earth. However, the Doctor and his friends soon find themselves fighting a threat closer to home – in order to save his astronaut son, the American General Cutler intends to attack Mondas with a Z-Bomb despite the danger that the radiation from the explosion will render half of Earth uninhabitable. The Doctor realises that the Cybermen have invaded Earth because Mondas is drawing away too much energy, and that their best hope is simply to stall the Cybermen until Mondas explodes of its own accord. But the energy drain is affecting the elderly Doctor's health, and when he finally returns to his TARDIS he collapses – and before Ben's and Polly's eyes, he seems to change into an entirely different person...

  <Overview>The Doctor appears to have transformed into an entirely different person, but Ben and Polly are unsure whether this strange man really is the Doctor or not. They soon have other matters to worry about, as the TARDIS takes them to a human colony on the planet Vulcan. Rebel activity is causing trouble for the colony governor, an Earth Examiner has recently been murdered, and the colony scientist Lesterson is obsessed with his experiments on an alien capsule unearthed from the mercury swamps. The Doctor takes the Examiner's place in order to investigate his murder, but soon discovers that the alien capsule is far more significant – for it contains dormant Daleks which Lesterson has woken. Lesterson believes that the Daleks are harmless robots which can be used to serve the colony, while the rebels are far more interested in the uses of the Daleks' in-built weaponry. Nobody will listen to the Doctor when he warns them that the Daleks have their own agenda – one which could result in the extermination of all human beings in the colony.

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises on Culloden Moor just after the rout of the Jacobite rebels in 1745. The British army is mopping up survivors, and when they find the Doctor and Ben in the company of rebels they are accused of desertion and arrested. They are saved from execution by Solicitor Grey, the Commissioner of Prisons – but he has his own agenda for the prisoners. Imprisoned in Inverness, the Doctor realises that Grey is running a scam of his own, removing rebels from the prisons with the promise that they will be saved from execution if they sign contracts binding them to service in the Jamaican plantations. In short, he's a slave trader. While the Doctor and Ben try to find a way to escape and help their new friends, Polly and Kirsty MacLaren, whose father has been kidnapped by Grey, blackmail an English officer into helping them locate their kidnapped friends and family. The Doctor and his companions must then find their way back to the TARDIS through a battlefield, and the young Highland piper who helps them, Jamie McCrimmon, accompanies them on their travels.

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises on Culloden Moor just after the rout of the Jacobite rebels in 1745. The British army is mopping up survivors, and when they find the Doctor and Ben in the company of rebels they are accused of desertion and arrested. They are saved from execution by Solicitor Grey, the Commissioner of Prisons – but he has his own agenda for the prisoners. Imprisoned in Inverness, the Doctor realises that Grey is running a scam of his own, removing rebels from the prisons with the promise that they will be saved from execution if they sign contracts binding them to service in the Jamaican plantations. In short, he's a slave trader. While the Doctor and Ben try to find a way to escape and help their new friends, Polly and Kirsty MacLaren, whose father has been kidnapped by Grey, blackmail an English officer into helping them locate their kidnapped friends and family. The Doctor and his companions must then find their way back to the TARDIS through a battlefield, and the young Highland piper who helps them, Jamie McCrimmon, accompanies them on their travels.

  <Overview>The Doctor and his friends materialise on a volcanic island, where they are kidnapped by natives of an underground civilisation. To the Doctor's great surprise, these are the survivors of Atlantis – and the famous Professor Zaroff, thought to have died twenty years ago, is amongst them. Zaroff has provided the Atlanteans with a new source of food, has taught them how to surgically convert their slave caste into Fish People who can survive underwater, and has promised to raise Atlantis from the waves. Only the Doctor realises that Zaroff is mad, and that his &quot;plan&quot; to raise Atlantis will in fact result in the destruction of the Earth.

  <Overview>Trying to take his companions to Mars, the Doctor instead ends up on the Moon in the year 2070. Earth's weather is controlled by means of gravity waves directed from an internationally-run Moonbase, but the staff of the Moonbase are suffering from a mysterious outbreak of plague, and moments after the Doctor and his friends enter the entire Moonbase is placed under quarantine. The Doctor offers to help find a cure for the plague, which he suspects is no plague at all – and he's right. The base's food supplies have in fact been poisoned by Cybermen from the colony world Telos, who intend to seize control of the Graviton and use it to destroy the Earth – not as revenge for the destruction of Mondas, but simply and logically to eliminate a potential threat.

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises in a human colony which is run like a giant holiday camp, where everybody is happy all round and fun and games are the order of the day. But a madman named Medok claims that the camp is stalked at night by hideous monsters, and as the Doctor learns more about the camp he realises that the people here risk their lives daily to mine a dangerously toxic natural gas – and yet nobody knows what it's for. His investigation attempt hits a snag when Ben is brainwashed by the colony's subliminal conditioning, and turns in his friends for acting against colony interests. In fact, the colony is under the control of the Macra, giant crab-like insects who are using the brainwashed humans to mine the gas they need to survive. It's up to the Doctor and his friends to prove the truth and free the colonists from a slavery they don't even know they're suffering.

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises on a runway at Gatwick Airport, and when the Doctor and his friends scatter to avoid policemen, Polly witnesses a murder in an airplane hangar. She tells the Doctor, but is then kidnapped – and reappears shortly afterwards, bearing a passport from Zurich and claiming to have no idea who the Doctor is. Jamie meets a young woman named Samantha who's looking for her missing brother, and when a detective from Scotland Yard shows up looking for his missing colleague, the airport Commandant is forced to concede that something very odd is going on. The Doctor soon discovers that &quot;Chameleon Tours&quot;, ostensibly offering cheap package tours for students and hitch-hiking youths, is in fact a front for a massive kidnapping operation. The alien Chameleons, who lost their personal identities in a cosmic accident, intend to steal the identities of the thousands of kidnapped youths, and the Doctor and his friends must stop them. When the situation is resolved, Ben and Polly discover that this is the very day on which they began travelling with the First Doctor, and choose to remain in London.

  <Overview>The TARDIS is stolen from Gatwick Airport, and when the Doctor and Jamie investigate they stumble into a trap set by Edward Waterfield, a time-traveller from the year 1866. His daughter Victoria has been kidnapped by the Daleks, in order to force him to lure the Doctor into their clutches. The Daleks have realised that human beings possess unique qualities which have enabled them to defeat the Daleks on every occasion the two races have fought; thus, the Daleks order the Doctor to monitor Jamie while he attempts to rescue Victoria, and synthesise the elusive Human Factor, which they intend to add to their own genetic makeup. The Doctor does so, and as he'd hoped, the test Daleks imbued with the Human Factor become playful and friendly. However, the Dalek Emperor then reveals that his real intention was to isolate the Dalek Factor and force the Doctor to spread it to the rest of humanity. The Emperor's plan fails, however, as the Doctor is not human and the Dalek Factor has no effect on him. The Doctor therefore tricks the Emperor into administring the Human Factor to several more Daleks, who begin to question authority and rebel against the Emperor. Waterfield dies saving the Doctor's life, and the Doctor and Jamie take Victoria with them as they depart, leaving the Dalek factions to fight each other to the death.

  <Overview>The TARDIS is stolen from Gatwick Airport, and when the Doctor and Jamie investigate they stumble into a trap set by Edward Waterfield, a time-traveller from the year 1866. His daughter Victoria has been kidnapped by the Daleks, in order to force him to lure the Doctor into their clutches. The Daleks have realised that human beings possess unique qualities which have enabled them to defeat the Daleks on every occasion the two races have fought; thus, the Daleks order the Doctor to monitor Jamie while he attempts to rescue Victoria, and synthesise the elusive Human Factor, which they intend to add to their own genetic makeup. The Doctor does so, and as he'd hoped, the test Daleks imbued with the Human Factor become playful and friendly. However, the Dalek Emperor then reveals that his real intention was to isolate the Dalek Factor and force the Doctor to spread it to the rest of humanity. The Emperor's plan fails, however, as the Doctor is not human and the Dalek Factor has no effect on him. The Doctor therefore tricks the Emperor into administring the Human Factor to several more Daleks, who begin to question authority and rebel against the Emperor. Waterfield dies saving the Doctor's life, and the Doctor and Jamie take Victoria with them as they depart, leaving the Dalek factions to fight each other to the death.

  <Overview>A team of archaeologists travels to the planet Telos, the home of the Cybermen, to excavate the tombs of the long-extinct cybernetic race. At least, it's assumed that they're extinct. The Doctor isn't sure that the tombs should be disturbed, but he soon comes to suspect that some of the &quot;archaeologists&quot; have an agenda far more dangerous than the team leader, Parry, suspects. In order to find out what the sinister Kleig and Kaftan are really up to, the Doctor helps the archaeologists to enter the tombs – where they find that the Cybermen are only dormant, not dead, and that Kleig and Kaftan intend to revive them. But they have underestimated the power of the Cybermen, and only the Doctor can save the archaeologists from being transformed into Cybermen themselves.

  <Overview>The Doctor returns to a Tibetan monastery which he hasn't visited for 300 years, only to be accused of murder. The legendary Yeti, normally timid and elusive creatures, have suddenly become vicious and savage, and many monks and visitors to the monastery have been killed. The Doctor faces suspicion from the monks and from the British explorer Travers, who's determined to prove that the Yeti exist and initially fears that the Doctor is from a rival expedition. Eventually the Doctor discovers that the savage Yeti are robots, built by an alien Intelligence who has possessed one of the monks. The Intelligence claims that it only wants physical being – but in fact, its new physical form will consume the entire Earth unless stopped.

  <Overview>In the 30th century, Earth is experiencing a new Ice Age, and bases all across the world are struggling to hold back the advancing glaciers. Brittanicus Base is running into difficulty, however, as Leader Clent's stubborn reliance on the base computer has alienated the humanist scientist Penley, who has deserted the base and gone out to live in the snowy wilderness outside. When the Doctor shows up, Clent enlists his help to get the malfunctioning Ioniser back on-line. However, more problems ensue when the frozen body of a Martian warrior is discovered in the nearby glacier. If an alien spacecraft is buried in the glacier, then use of the Ioniser at full power could cause its power source to explode and irradiate all of Britain. And then the Ice Warrior unexpectedly returns to life, kidnaps Victoria, revives the others of its kind and prepares to attack the presumably hostile base...

  <Overview>In the 30th century, Earth is experiencing a new Ice Age, and bases all across the world are struggling to hold back the advancing glaciers. Brittanicus Base is running into difficulty, however, as Leader Clent's stubborn reliance on the base computer has alienated the humanist scientist Penley, who has deserted the base and gone out to live in the snowy wilderness outside. When the Doctor shows up, Clent enlists his help to get the malfunctioning Ioniser back on-line. However, more problems ensue when the frozen body of a Martian warrior is discovered in the nearby glacier. If an alien spacecraft is buried in the glacier, then use of the Ioniser at full power could cause its power source to explode and irradiate all of Britain. And then the Ice Warrior unexpectedly returns to life, kidnaps Victoria, revives the others of its kind and prepares to attack the presumably hostile base...

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises in 21st-century Earth, where the Doctor discovers that he's the exact double of the philanthropic scientist Salamander. Salamander has ended world hunger and has been supplying humanitarian aid to parts of the world which have recently suffered inexplicable seismic activity. However, his former associate, Giles Kent, claims that Salamander is in fact a power-crazed maniac who's slowly replacing the authorities of Earth with lackeys under his thumb. The Doctor isn't so sure, and agrees to impersonate Salamander and find out the truth only if Jamie and Victoria can prove to his satisfaction that Salamander is indeed an evil man. However, Jamie and Victoria soon find themselves in over their heads – and even before he has a chance to act, the Doctor is already being hunted by Donald Bruce, the suspicious chief of World Zone security.

  <Overview>The TARDIS is caught by a mysterious force which causes it to materialise in present-day London. Forty years have passed since their adventure in Tibet, and their old friend Professor Travers has succeeded in reactivating one of the dormant Yeti control spheres – only to summon the Great Intelligence back to Earth. The streets of London are choked with fog, Yeti roam the Underground, and a beleaguered team of soldiers and scientists struggles to find a solution before the city falls completely to the invader. A new commander arrives, Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart – but is he really the new commander of the garrison or is he the Intelligence's new human agent? And if he isn't, then who is? The Doctor must find the traitor before the base is overrun by the Web and London falls...

  <Overview>The TARDIS is caught by a mysterious force which causes it to materialise in present-day London. Forty years have passed since their adventure in Tibet, and their old friend Professor Travers has succeeded in reactivating one of the dormant Yeti control spheres – only to summon the Great Intelligence back to Earth. The streets of London are choked with fog, Yeti roam the Underground, and a beleaguered team of soldiers and scientists struggles to find a solution before the city falls completely to the invader. A new commander arrives, Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart – but is he really the new commander of the garrison or is he the Intelligence's new human agent? And if he isn't, then who is? The Doctor must find the traitor before the base is overrun by the Web and London falls...

  <Overview>The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria arrive at an outpost drilling for natural gas in the North Sea. Mysterious heartbeat sounds are echoing through the pipes, there have been drops in pressure, and contact has been lost with several offshore rigs. Victoria is attacked by a monstrous form of living seaweed, and some of the base personnel are possessed by the poisonous Weed, which stings them and draws them under its control. As the Weed steps up its attack on the base, the Doctor discovers that it's vulnerable to high-frequency sounds, and drives it off with the help of Victoria's screams – amplified by his trusty new invention, the sonic screwdriver. However, Victoria has had enough, and she chooses to remain on Earth, albeit a century after her own time.

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises on a deserted rocket in deep space, where the Doctor suffers concussion after an abrupt course change, and he and Jamie are attacked by a hostile servo-robot. Jamie manages to attract attention from a nearby space station, but the crew then attempt to destroy the apparently deserted rocket – and in order to save the TARDIS, Jamie must sabotage the station's asteroid defense laser. He and the Doctor thus face extremly hostile questioning, but the real threat is aboard the space rocket, where two Cybermen are preparing to infiltrate the station, open the way for their army to arrive and use the Wheel as the first stepping stone in an invasion of Earth. After the Cybermen are defeated, the Doctor and Jamie depart with a new companion – computer programmer Zoe Heriot, who finds her ordinary life dull and seeks adventure with them.

Jamie manages to attract attention from a nearby space station, but the crew then attempt to destroy the apparently deserted rocket – and in order to save the TARDIS, Jamie must sabotage the station's asteroid defense laser. He and the Doctor thus face extremly hostile questioning, but the real threat is aboard the space rocket, where two Cybermen are preparing to infiltrate the station, open the way for their army to arrive and use the Wheel as the first stepping stone in an invasion of Earth. After the Cybermen are defeated, the Doctor and Jamie depart with a new companion – computer programmer Zoe Heriot, who finds her ordinary life dull and seeks adventure with them.

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises on Dulkis, a world where war has been outlawed. Several years ago, atomic tests were conducted on the Island of Death, but now a survey team from the local university discovers that all of the radioactive fallout has vanished. The Doctor and his friends aren't the only visitors to Dulkis; two Dominators and their robot servants, the Quarks, have landed on the island, and their ship has sucked up all of the radiation into its engines. When the Dominators encounter the members of the survey team, they take them captive and work them to exhaustion, clearing space to drill into the bedrock of the island while testing the Dulcians' suitability as slaves. The Doctor must convince the complacent senate of Dulkis that their world faces a real threat – before the Dominators destroy the entire planet simply to fuel their space fleet.

  <Overview>Trying to escape from a volcanic eruption, the Doctor activates the TARDIS' emergency circuits, taking his ship out of real time and space altogether. However, the void is inhabited by a hypnotic force which lures Jamie and Zoe outside, keeping the Doctor distracted until the strain on the TARDIS becomes too great and the ship explodes. The Doctor and his companions find themselves in a Land of Fiction, where wordplay can be deadly and fictional characters come to life. The travellers must make their way to the castle at the centre of the Land, while the Master of the Land of Fiction waits for them to make the wrong move and transform themselves into fictional characters and thus pawns under his control.</Overview>

  <Overview>The TARDIS is in need of repair, but when the Doctor tries to track down an old friend for help he falls into the hands of Tobias Vaughn, the megalomaniac CEO of International Electromatics. The electronics company is under observation by the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, a new international military team for fighting threats from beyond the Earth – headed by the Doctor and Jamie's old friend, Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart (promoted to Brigadier following the Yeti invasion). Vaughn is in league with aliens who intend to invade Earth, but he intends to betray them and seize control; however, as insurance should his plans fail, he wants the Doctor's TARDIS. When Vaughn kidnaps Zoe, the Doctor requests UNIT's help to rescue her – but their interference forces Vaughn to advance the invasion schedule, leaving the Doctor with little time to mount a defense… and the situation becomes more urgent when the Doctor realises that Vaughn's allies are the Cybermen, and that their army is already in place in the sewers beneath London, waiting for the signal to attack.

When Vaughn kidnaps Zoe, the Doctor requests UNIT's help to rescue her – but their interference forces Vaughn to advance the invasion schedule, leaving the Doctor with little time to mount a defense… and the situation becomes more urgent when the Doctor realises that Vaughn's allies are the Cybermen, and that their army is already in place in the sewers beneath London, waiting for the signal to attack.

  <Overview>For centuries the alien Krotons have hidden inside their Machine in the Hall of Learning, educating a small settlement of Gonds and selecting the two best students of each graduating class to become their Companions. This is seen as a great honour – until the Doctor and his friends arrive and discover that the Companions are in fact being killed. This revelation rocks Gond society to its foundations, and while the ambitious councillor Eelek seizes the opportunity to stage a coup and grasp power for himself, the Doctor and his friends investigate the Krotons' true agenda. Unfortunately, while doing so the Doctor and Zoe inadvertently wake the Krotons, crystalline conquerors who have been dormant for centuries waiting for the Gonds to become intelligent enough to provide them with the mental energy they need to power their spacecraft. And now that the Doctor and Zoe have arrived, they'll do nicely.

  <Overview>In the 21st century, all travel is conducted via T-Mat, an instantaneous travel and transport system operated from a Moonbase. Space flight has been all but forgotten - and as a result, when contact is lost with the Moonbase, there appears to be no way to repair T-Mat system. As the world begins to slide into chaos and anarchy, the Doctor and his companions arrive just in time to volunteer for an emergency rocket flight to the Moon, where they discover that the Moonbase has been invaded by Ice Warriors. Now T-Mat is under their control, and despite resistance from the Moonbase crew, the Ice Warriors will soon be able to use it as a weapon to transmat deadly seed pods to Earth, transforming the planet's atmosphere and climate and enabling their army to invade.</Overview>

  <Overview>In the 21st century, all travel is conducted via T-Mat, an instantaneous travel and transport system operated from a Moonbase. Space flight has been all but forgotten - and as a result, when contact is lost with the Moonbase, there appears to be no way to repair T-Mat system. As the world begins to slide into chaos and anarchy, the Doctor and his companions arrive just in time to volunteer for an emergency rocket flight to the Moon, where they discover that the Moonbase has been invaded by Ice Warriors. Now T-Mat is under their control, and despite resistance from the Moonbase crew, the Ice Warriors will soon be able to use it as a weapon to transmat deadly seed pods to Earth, transforming the planet's atmosphere and climate and enabling their army to invade.</Overview>

  <Overview>The TARDIS materialises on a beacon station in deep space moments before space pirates break it up for its argonite. General Hermack of the Space Corps vows to stop the pirates by any means necessary, and when the grizzled old prospector Milo Clancey shows up in a restricted area of space, Hermack concludes that he must be involved in some way. In order to recover the TARDIS from the pirates, the Doctor, Zoe and Jamie must join forces with Clancey as he evades the Space Corps and tries to prove that the real leader of the pirates is the dastardly Maurice Caven. However, this proves more difficult when Caven is revealed to be in league with Clancey's rival, Madeline Issigri – and with her somewhat unwilling help, Caven plans to kill Clancey and his new friends and frame them for the pirate attacks, thus getting away scot-free with his crimes.

  <Overview>The TARDIS lands in what appears to be the front-line trenches at the height of battle in war-torn France, right in the middle of World War I. Everyone they meet are convinced that the crew are spying and it doesn't take long for the crew to be on the run, but not before breaking the hypnotic conditioning of Carstairs and Lady Jennifer. Having escaped one war-zone they find themselves in another - Roman occupied Britain of some 2,000 years ago, then on to the American Civil War. The situation worstens when the Doctor suspects one of his own people, a Time Lord, to be behind the War Games working for a race of aliens trying to run the wars to their conclusions under controlled conditions to find a super-army or fighters. The Doctor is faced with an impossible situation - not only does the War Lords' control over hundreds of thousands of fighters need to be removed, but the soldiers have to be returned to their natural habitats. He conceeds defeat at the task, knowing that the TARDIS is not equipped for the task. He sends an SOS, calling in his own people even though it is revealed that he is 'on the run' from them for the theft of a TARDIS and for meddling... The Doctor is caught and faces trial.

He sends an SOS, calling in his own people even though it is revealed that he is 'on the run' from them for the theft of a TARDIS and for meddling... The Doctor is caught and faces trial.

  <Overview>The TARDIS lands in what appears to be the front-line trenches at the height of battle in war-torn France, right in the middle of World War I. Everyone they meet are convinced that the crew are spying and it doesn't take long for the crew to be on the run, but not before breaking the hypnotic conditioning of Carstairs and Lady Jennifer. Having escaped one war-zone they find themselves in another - Roman occupied Britain of some 2,000 years ago, then on to the American Civil War. The situation worstens when the Doctor suspects one of his own people, a Time Lord, to be behind the War Games working for a race of aliens trying to run the wars to their conclusions under controlled conditions to find a super-army or fighters. The Doctor is faced with an impossible situation - not only does the War Lords' control over hundreds of thousands of fighters need to be removed, but the soldiers have to be returned to their natural habitats. He concedes defeat, knowing that the TARDIS is not equipped for the task. He sends an SOS, calling in his own people even though it is revealed that he is 'on the run' from them for the theft of a TARDIS and for meddling... The Doctor is caught and faces trial.

  <Overview>Gallifrey, world of the Time Lords. The Doctor has claimed the presidency of the planet (on a technicality, following events in the previous season's The Deadly Assassin) and his behaviour is even more eccentric than usual in other ways, too: he refuses to speak to Leela and seems only to trust K9. But has he really betrayed Gallifrey to a Vardan invasion force? And is there a further power behind the Vardans?</Overview>

  <Overview>The Doctor and Romana visit Chronotis, a retired Time Lord living in Cambridge, who admits that he's lost a book dating back to the time of Rassilon and needs their help to find it. In fact he's accidentally lent it out to graduate student Chris Parsons, who soon realises that this is an extraordinary text indeed. The book is also sought by the evil scientist Skagra, who has developed a sphere capable of drawing its victims' minds out of their bodies. Skagra needs the book to reach the Time Lord prison Shada, which even the Time Lords have forgotten. Long ago they imprisoned the criminal Salyavin there, as punishment for using his powers to transfer his mind into other people's bodies. Chronotis is eventually forced to admit that he himself is Salyavin; he escaped long ago and used his powers to cause the Time Lords to forget about his prison. However, he's now repented of his crimes and wishes to live a quiet, peaceful life. Skagra drains Chronotis's mind and thus acquires the ability to transfer his own mind into other bodies; with the aid of the sphere and his crystalline servants, the Krargs, he will spread his own mind throughout the Universe and become immortal. However, when the Doctor pretends to be stupid, the sphere fails to drain his mind completely. He thus survives, and since there's a copy of his mind inside the sphere, he is able to use the resonance to turn Skagra's possessed slaves against him. Skagra is imprisoned by his own Ship, and Chronotis returns to Earth to resume his peaceful retirement.

But the ship is headed for the notorious plague colony, Terminus. Surrounded by plague victims and space pirates, is the Doctor too preoccupied to notice the greatest threat of all - a threat connected to the position of Terminus at the exact centre of the universe?
