  <Overview>Dalziel, Superintendent Andrew, and Inspector Peter Pascoe Hill's Yorkshire detectives are another entry in a long line of excellent British police procedural's, a subgenre that may more truly define the British mystery than the so-called cozy. Dalziel (pronounced, according to the author, &quot;Deeell&quot;), is middle-aged, fat, and a realist to the point just short of being a cynic. He is shrewd and a top-notch investigator. Pascoe is younger, college educated, and on the way up. A sergeant when we meet him, he is a detective chief inspector in the most recent book. He's married and has one child. The series is given a certain edge by the fact that, while the men work well together and respect each others abilities, they are not bosom buddies in the manner of so many detective teams. While working in the procedural vein and giving us a close-up picture of life in Yorkshire from the cities to the small mining towns, Hill still frequently provides clues and solutions worthy of a classic puzzle.</Overview>

  <Overview>The first episode see Dalziel picking up his once sociable roots - and returning to Wetherton Rugby Football Club where he is still a member. But his visit is not sparked off by a desire to down a few friendly pints in the bar. Connon the club's star player - he was tipped to play for England before an ankle injury wrecked his chances - has returned home from Saturday's match dazed and confused after a deliberate blow on the head in the confusion of a scrum.
Still groggy, he goes to lie down leaving his wife Mary watching television. Some time later when he descends the stairs he finds her sitting in exactly the same position. There is just one difference - a neat, round and lethal hole in her skull. Has Connon killed his wife suspecting that she had ben unfaithful? Or could someone at the club have it in for the rugby star and his family?</Overview>

  <Overview>Pascoe is back on familiar territory when he is called to Holm Coltram University, along with his straight-talking, mickey-taking boss, the formidable Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel.
But it is not the groves of academe that are calling to Dalziel, it is the lure of the unearthed body of a mystery middle-aged woman - buried underneath a statue commemorating the late head of the college.
For Pascoe the discovery of the remains at the university gives him the chance to meet up once more with Ellie who is a lecturer there. The couple's relationship looks like it's ripe for renovation. The university campus becomes a temporary headquarters for Dalziel and Pascoe as they set up their office in the Principal's study. They soon learn that all is not as it seems at this seat of learning</Overview>

  <Overview>Dick Elgood, an old fiend of Dalziel's, unofficially reports two strange incidents which nearly kill him and asks Dalziel to investigate. The subsequent investigation by him and Pascoe exposes a chain of bizarre, accidental deaths stretching back nearly three decades but not a single shred of evidence to suggest foul play! Each of the, seemingly unconnected, deaths have somehow or other benefited Patrick Alderman even though it could not be proven that he had any connection to the deaths. The trail leads to Penny Highsmith, an old flame of Dalziel's, but goes cold when she is shown not to be involved. The case is eventually closed with the death, in mysterious circumstances, of Dick Elgood, the victim of yet another weird accident.</Overview>

  <Overview>In the village of Thirksby the mine is being broken down to make way for a new hi tech factory. Protestors at the site storm the site and this leads to the uncovering of a skeleton, who has been there since the strikes of 84/85.   The victim turns out to be a bent undercover cop, who was supposed to have run off with 250000 pounds meant for the strikers.

Peter Pascoe starts to doubt his superior as he researches Dalziels involvement 15 years ago.   Dalziel sees his sister for the first time in 7 years but time has not improved their relationship.   As the developer of the old mine is found murdered the secrets start to be revealed, opening some old wounds and causing some new ones.</Overview>

Dalziel and Pascoe visit Wilkie's regiment and his home, only to find that it has just been ransacked and set on fire by an intruder; Dalziel tells Pascoe he is too close to the suspects to stay on the case; instead he can remain at his parents' and hope to pick up gossip.
Pascoe does not get on with his father, who has always resented his son's decision not to go into farming, especially after the recent hardships of the foot-and-mouth outbreak. Instead, Bill Pascoe has relied for help on Pascoe's cousin, T</Overview>

  <Overview>Dalziel and Pascoe attend a retirement party for a senior colleague, Donald Fitzgerald. Dalziel's distinctly unhappy. He cannot forgive Fitzgerald for losing a recent court case against local villain and long standing adversary Danny Macer. He's even angrier when Macer turns up to celebrate, but anger turns to suspicion when Fitzgerald's found dead on a golf course the following morning.
As the team examine Fitzgerald's soured personal life, including his affair with physiotherapist Rachel Waller, Dalziel goes after Macer. Pascoe tries to keep the investigation on course, but Dalziel's obsession soon leads him into confrontation with both Pascoe and his boss. ACC Stella Applegarth orders him back off duty on grounds of ill-health. Pascoe takes over, but soon finds evidence - a key leading to a bank vault and a suitcase full of money - which suggests that Dalziel's instincts about Fitzgerald may have been right.
As Pascoe explores the implications, a second murder, that of Rachel Waller</Overview>

  <Overview>Dalziel's car breaks down on the moors and unsurprisingly Pascoe won't come fetch him in the middle of the night
Dalziel walks to a nearby pub and stays the night. The next morning he discovers a body while taking a walk and suddenly a bigger case unfolds.

The landlord's son was convicted of murdering his wife but her body was never found. He has escaped while in transit and is expected to arrive at the pub to see his son.

Suddenly the wife's body turns up, and it's clear it has been stored somewhere for a number of years. Dalziel does some digging and discovers the real murderer is much closer to home.</Overview>

  <Overview>What is the connection between an unidentifiable corpse found drowned in the canal with a two-year-old AK47 bullet lodged in his spine and the murder of a wealthy, successful businessman who has just returned from Russia with a new order and a new Russian bride-to-be? This is the mystery that Dalziel and Pascoe must solve if they are to discover the murderer before Dalziel is moved sideways into a desk job to make way for &quot;new blood&quot;. The strange thing about the case is that nobody seems particularly upset about the death of the businessman. As they probe deeper into the case all sorts of jealousies, money problems and family conflicts are exposed. Also, the factory staff is trying desperately to conceal various wrongdoings from the police. Eventually, the murder weapon is discovered and a suspect confesses to the crime but is she the real murderer?</Overview>

  <Overview>Pascoe is rushed to hospital with serious injuries following a car crash, and slips into a coma. Dalziel keeps a vigil at his bedside and realises just how much his partner means to him.

Meanwhile, when a local fisherman reels in a gruesome catch â€“ a human foot â€“ and police divers discover other body parts amongst illegally dumped waste in a nearby lake, Dalziel finds himself at the centre of a potential murder enquiry.

As the case unravels, Dalziel discovers an uneasy relationship between Wetherton's leading hospital physician, Dr McKenzie Mansfield, and neurology consultant Mr Alisdair Collinson, not to mention a snake pit of political wranglings with local business tycoon, and the main source of the hospital's funding, Barry Jemmerson.
Dalziel finds himself torn between trying to cope with Pascoe's continuing deterioration and his duty as a policeman to throw himself into this very intricate and gruesome case.</Overview>

  <Overview>When WPC 'Janet' Jackson is involved in a raid on a Chinese warehouse packed with illegal immigrants, she has no idea of the horror about to unfold.
The day after the raid, an animal rights activist who had a grudge against the zoo is found dead in the zoo's tiger enclosure. It looks as though the tigers have mauled him but, when Dalziel and Pascoe arrive, they discover that the death is more suspicious.

The murder victim is Robin Challoner, a fanatical animal rights activist with a particular grievance against Guy Latimer and his zoo. He is identified by his mother, Jenny Challoner, who appears unmoved by her son's death...


Guy's zoo and hi-tech surgery - which deals with unusual veterinary cases from all over the world - lie in the grounds of a stately home, once the site of an infamous murder case.

Its owner, Lord Tiger Harper, disappeared after the murder of Billy Huddlestone in the Seventies. He was never seen again but left the estate in Guy's care. However, as the mystery of what happened to Lord Harper and Robin Challoner unravels, the team discovers the appalling truth behind the facade of the zoo...</Overview>

There is a conflict of the old and the new as a proposed site for a new road bypass is allowed to be excavated by a team of archaeologists from the local university. It's a race against time for Dr Rix's archaeological team to find what she believes should be the ancient site of Queen Cartimandua's burial, before the road builders arrive and cover the whole area with tarmac for good.

But when the site becomes a crime scene it is closed to both the dig and the builders, causing friction between the two groups. After a fight, the site is destroyed and with it any police evidence.

However, when one of the builders is discovered dead in his caravan the finger of suspicion points to a local criminal, who Dalziel helped convict years previously for a particularly vicious murder....</Overview>

  <Overview>Dalziel and Pascoe are going to Amsterdam for a police conference. On the night of their arrival it already goes wrong, when the men lose each other.

  <Overview>On Halloween, Kate Johnson is killed in her bedroom, the victim of a shotgun blast. Her husband Guy is the obvious suspect, having now disappeared. In an odd twist, the couple had been part of a television broadcast the previous Halloween where hypnotist Lee Knight demonstrated that people could be induced to do anything, including murder. The dead woman's daughter, Katherine Taylor, is convinced that the hypnotic suggestions of a year ago are what caused her father to kill her mother and that Knight is responsible. When she is found dead however, the case takes yet another turn. Meanwhile, Dalziel undergoes hypnotherapy to quit smoking.</Overview>

  <Overview>A sunburned Det. Supt Andy Dalziel returns from his holiday in Australia and finds himself immediately investigating a murder. The dead man is Declan Roach, a researcher at the local university who was found in a university laboratory clean room. The autopsy confirms that he died from nitrogen intoxication but it is not clear at first if it was accidental or not. Roach was working under the direction of Professor Fran Cunningham, who in turn has a major contract with Aphrodite, a major cosmetics firm. She is working on a formula for a rejuvenation cream that will be nothing less than a fountain of youth and there is obviously a great deal of money at stake. Andy meanwhile is thinking of packing it in and emigrating to Australia.</Overview>

  <Overview>With a second murder to investigate, the police are no further ahead. Animal rights activists had been threatening Declan Roach and there was a good deal of tension on the team. Professor Cunningham had a falling out with him when she learned that he had signed a lucrative contract with Aphrodite. As well, it is apparent that the trials of Cunningham's fountain of youth have been sabotaged by one of the participants. Andy's hopes of immigrating to Australia hit a snag.</Overview>

  <Overview>When accused pedophile Michael Wheeler is acquitted in the murder of two teens, Det. Supt. Dalziel and DI Pascoe find themselves continuing to suspect him when another teen, the principal witness against him, disappears. Pascoe in particular is taking it all quite hard in that he had promised the parents that justice would be done. When one of the bereaved parents kills Wheeler, Pascoe decides to cover up the crime. In what proves to be a parallel case, the police find two bodies, one of a taxi and the other of a teenage girl, both of whom were murdered in exactly the same way and drained of their blood.</Overview>
